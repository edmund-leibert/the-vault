### 11.4: [Sorting an array using selection sort](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/sorting-an-array-using-selection-sort/)

In C++, how does one implement selection sort? #card-reverse 
```cpp
// to be filled!
```


**Question**: Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts. What does the algorithm find and swap to move the sublist boundaries one element to the right? #card-reverse 
**Answer**: The algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted sublist and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.


**Question**: What is the time complexity of selection sort? #card-reverse 
**Answer**: The time complexity of <span class="spoiler">selection sort</span> is $O(n)$ in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the input list.


**Question**: What is the space complexity of selection sort? #card-reverse
**Answer**: The space complexity of <span class="spoiler">selection sort</span> is $O(1)$, because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the temporary index of the smallest element and the swap operation.


**Question**: What are the advantages of selection sort? #card-reverse 
**Answer**: The advantages of <span class="spoiler">selection sort</span> are:
- Simple to implement
- Works well on small input sizes
- Requires only $O(1)$ extra space


**Question**: What are the disadvantages of <span class="spoiler">selection sort</span>? #card-reverse 
**Answer**: The disadvantages of selection sort are:
- Slow for large input sizes
- Not stable (i.e., it may change the relative order of equal elements)
- Requires $O(n)$ comparisons and $O(n)$ swaps, where n is the number of elements in the input list.
