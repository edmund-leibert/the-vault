Consider the scenario where an _array_ of objects is represented as‚Ä¶

```js
dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values`)
```

Is the following code a valid approach in order to iterate and access each elements underlying object structure?

```js
for(let value in dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values) { 
	console.log(value.title);
}
```

#card 

In JavaScript, iterating over an object or array has specific semantics that you need to be aware of. The `for...in` loop is generally used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. When you use `for...in` on an array, the loop variable (`value` in your case) will hold the index of the array element, **_not_** the element itself. 

In your code snippet:

```javascript
for(let value in dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values) {
	console.log(value.title);
}
```

The variable `value` will hold the index (or key, in case of objects) instead of the actual object stored at that index.

To iterate over an array and get each object directly, you can use `for...of` instead:

```javascript
for(let value of dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values) {
	console.log(value.title);
}
```

Note: I'm assuming `dv.pages().values` returns an array. If it doesn't, you may need to adapt this example to fit the actual data structure.

Another option is to use the `.forEach()` method if your data structure is an array:

```javascript
dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values.forEach((value) => {
	console.log(value.title);
});
```

Lastly, make sure that‚Ä¶
```js
dv.pages(`"${current_folder}"`).values
```
‚Ä¶actually returns what you expect it to return. Debugging that might provide more insight into the issue.

Ôπá<br>
What is the same origin policy? 

#card-reverse 

This policy dictates that JavaScript from one page may not access the other page if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).

Ôπá<br>
Can a website with JavaScript still be considered a ‚Äústatic‚Äù website?

#card 


As far as the required server infrastructure is concerned, a website with JavaScript can still be considered static because it can be hosted by static hosting services (no server code involved).

What is a dynamic site? 

#card 

A dynamic site is a site with a server side language (php, python etc.) You could therefore have a dynamic site without JavaScript.

Ôπá<br>
What is a function in JavaScript? 

#card 

A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is defined with the¬†`function`¬†keyword, followed by a name and parentheses¬†`()`.

Ôπá<br>
How do you create a¬†`main`¬†function in JavaScript?¬†

#card 

In JavaScript, there is no concept of a¬†`main`¬†function like in other languages such as C or C++. However, you can create a function called¬†`main`¬†and call it at the beginning of your script to mimic the behavior of a¬†`main`¬†function in other languages.

Ôπá<br>
How do you specify the entry point of a JavaScript project? 

#card 

If you‚Äôre using a bundler or module system, you can specify the entry point of your project in its configuration. For example, if you‚Äôre using webpack, you can specify the entry point in the¬†`webpack.config.js`¬†file.

Ôπá<br>
In JavaScript, what is the difference between using single quotation marks (e.g., `'Hello'`) or double quotation marks (e.g., `"Hello"`)? 

#card 

There is no difference in JavaScript, they are both treated the same.

Only thing that matters is that you start, and end, with the same symbol.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1700690613150

Ôπá<br>
What are template literals? 

#card 

In the context of JavaScript, they allow you to put a variable directly into a string.

Declared by using \` (backticks) as opposed to single or double quotes.

Consider the following example‚Ä¶

```js
let name == "John Doe";
let greeting = `Hello ${name}`
console.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, John Doe!
```

The variable inside the placeholder can be any valid JavaScript expression. Notably, they can do much more‚Ä¶
- Evaluate JavaScript expressions
- Include line breaks as they are

Other than variable substitution, what else can template literals do? 

#card 

- Evaluate JavaScript expressions
- Include line breaks as they are

Ôπá<br>
When dealing with inline boolean expression, is the left, or right side, of the colon the value returned if the expression evaluated is true? 

#card 

The value to the left of the colon is true.

<br>Ôπà<br>^1700690613170

Ôπá<br>
Is `int` a data type in JavaScript?

#card 

No, `int` is not a data type in JavaScript. [JavaScript has the following data types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp) [@JavaScriptDataTypes]:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

[The `Number` data type in JavaScript represents both integers and floating-point numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)[2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number). [There is no separate integer type for everyday use](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)[2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number). [However, JavaScript does have a `BigInt` type for representing integers with arbitrary magnitude](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)[3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures). [But it‚Äôs not designed to replace `Number` for everyday uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)[2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number).

In most programming languages, numbers are often represented as different types like integers (`int`), short, long, floating-point, etc. [But in JavaScript, numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp) [@JavaScriptNumbers].

So, if you‚Äôre looking to use integers in JavaScript, you would use the `Number` or `BigInt` data type.

Ôπá<br>
In JavaScript, does the `trim()` method of `String` remove also trailing parentheses?

#card 

No, the `trim()` method in JavaScript does not remove parentheses at the end of a string. [It only removes whitespace from both ends of a string](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_trim_string.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_trim_string.asp)[2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim). If you want to remove parentheses or any other characters from the end of a string, you might need to use a different method, such as `replace()` with a suitable regular expression. Here‚Äôs an example:

```javascript
let str = "(Hello World)";
str = str.replace(/^\(|\)$/g, '');
console.log(str);  // Outputs: Hello World
```

In this example, the `replace()` method is used with a regular expression that matches parentheses at the start (`^\(`) or end (`\)$`) of the string, and replaces them with an empty string (effectively removing them).

Ôπá<br>
So the following regex match is too used on each line to capture headings. I get the regex regarding the match and the capture groups \#1 and \#2. It seems the first capture group is intended to get the whole heading, while the capture group \#2 is supposed to get the actual string/content of the heading (without the `#` at the start).

But I am confused, on the last part. What is the 3rd capture group for?

```javascript
/^ {0,3}(#{1,6}) +([^\n]+?) ?((?: *#\S+)*) *$/
```

#card 

The regular expression‚Ä¶
```javascript
/^ {0,3}(#{1,6}) +([^\n]+?) ?((?: *#\S+)*) *$/
``` 
 ‚Ä¶is used to match headings in Markdown syntax. Let‚Äôs break it down:
```javascript
^ {0,3}
```
- Matches the start of a line followed by zero to three spaces. This is to allow for optional indentation at the start of the line.
```javascript
(#{1,6})
```
- Matches between one and six hash symbols (`#`). This is the first capture group and it captures the actual Markdown syntax for the heading level (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).
```javascript
+([^\n]+?)
```
- Matches one or more characters that are not a newline (`\n`). This is the second capture group and it captures the text of the heading.
```javascript
?((?: *#\S+)*)
``` 
- Matches zero or one occurrence of a space followed by a hash symbol and one or more non-whitespace characters. This is the third capture group.

The third capture group is designed to capture optional closing `#` symbols in Setext-style headers. In some flavors of Markdown, you can optionally end a header with the same number of `#` symbols as at the start. For example, in the following header, the third capture group would capture the trailing `###`:

```markdown
### Header ###
```

However, this is not universally supported in all flavors of Markdown, and it‚Äôs not required by the original Markdown specification. So depending on the specific Markdown parser being used, this third capture group might not be necessary. If you‚Äôre not using a flavor of Markdown that supports optional closing `#` symbols, you could simplify the regular expression to‚Ä¶

```javascript
/^ {0,3}(#{1,6}) +([^\n]+?)/
```
