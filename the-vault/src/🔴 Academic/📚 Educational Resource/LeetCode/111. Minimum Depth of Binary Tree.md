## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for this problem?
#card 
‚ùóTo be filled.

#### Attempt #1 (2023-08-12) ‚è≤Ô∏è 00:30:00

What does is depth of an ‚Äúempty‚Äù tree. For example, consider the case where the given `head` is a `nullptr`.
#card 
The depth in this case is zero.
^1691865971359

What is the depth of a just a single a node? For example, consider the case where `head->left` and `head->right` are equal to `nullptr`.
#card 
The depth in this case is one.

What is the time complexity of depth-first search (DFS) using the recursive approach?
#card 
- [The time complexity of the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for a binary tree is $\mathcal{O}(n)$, where n is the number of nodes in the tree](https://www.codecademy.com/article/depth-first-search-conceptual)[1](https://www.codecademy.com/article/depth-first-search-conceptual). 
	- This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm will need to visit every node in the tree.
- [The space complexity of the DFS algorithm for a binary tree is also $\mathcal{O}(n)$, where n is the number of nodes in the tree](https://www.codecademy.com/article/depth-first-search-conceptual)[1](https://www.codecademy.com/article/depth-first-search-conceptual). 
	- This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm will need to store information about every node in the tree on the call stack when using a recursive approach.

What is the depth of a node in a tree?
#card 
The <span class="spoiler">depth of a node in a binary tree</span> is the number of edges from the root node to the node.

What are the characteristics/rules of a binary tree?
#card 
[A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree). Here are some characteristics/rules of a binary tree:
- [Each node in a binary tree has at most two children](about:blank#)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
- [The children of a node are usually referred to as the left child and the right child](about:blank#)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
- [A binary tree can be empty, in which case it has no nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
- A binary tree can be represented by a pointer to the topmost node (commonly known as the ‚Äúroot‚Äù) of the tree. [If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL](about:blank#)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/).
- [Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts: Data, Pointer to left child, Pointer to right child](about:blank#)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/).

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
#include <cmath>
class Solution {
public:
    int _minDepth(TreeNode* node) { // return height of node
        if(node == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        else {
            return std::min(_minDepth(node->left) + 1, _minDepth(node->right) + 1);
        }
    }
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == nullptr) {
            return -1;
        }
        if(root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
            return 1;
        }
        return _minDepth(root);
    }
};
```
#card 
The code provided is trying to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. 
- The depth of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges from the root node to the node.
- The minimum depth of a tree is the shortest path from the root node to any leaf node. 
There are a few issues with the provided code:
1. **Incorrect Base Cases**:
    - In the `_minDepth` function, when checking for leaf nodes, if either `node->left` or `node->right` is `nullptr`, it should be treated differently. 
        - In the current code, if just `node->left` is `nullptr`, then the depth of the right child is returned, which is not correct.
2. **Redundant checks in `minDepth`**:
    - You're doing a separate check for the root node being a leaf node, which is unnecessary. This can be handled in the recursive `_minDepth` function.
3. **Negative Return Value**:
    - The function should return 0 when `root` is `nullptr`, not -1. A negative depth doesn't make sense in this context.
