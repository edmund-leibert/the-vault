When doing $O$-notation analysis, how should I account for the space complexity of the final result? #card 
- You shouldn‚Äôt. Generally when dealing with space complexity we should only consider extra temporary space that is allocated in the algorithm.
- For example, consider an algorithm with two input strings $m$ and $n$ that produces a new output strong by merging each of the input strings together. In this case, the the space time complexity would be $O(1)$ because we are not creating anymore space outside of the space needed for the final result.

What is a faster, more modern alternative to adding a character to end of a string in C++? #card
- Can use the `push_back()` of the string class. Example is below‚Ä¶
```cpp
string word1 = "red"
string result = "";
int i = 0, j = 0;
while (i < m) {
	result.push_back(word1[i++]);
}
```
^1689963399224


In C++, how can detect a char is the end of a string if using a pointer in C++? #card 
- You can check to see if it is equal to the `'\0'` (i.e. the **null character**) value which signifies the end of a string.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    const char* str = "Hello, World!";
    const char* p = str;
    while (*p != '\0') {
        std::cout << *p;
        ++p;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

‚ùó To be filled.
^1689963399234

Does the C++ class `std::string` rely on the **null character**? #card 
No, it stores it size as an integer and does not rely on it.
^1689963399239

What is the best approach for this problem? #card 
```cpp
// Time: O(n+m)
// Space: O(1) *Not considering the space consumed by the input strings (word1 and word2) and the output string (word3)
#include<string>
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        const char* ptr1 = word1.c_str();
        const char* ptr2 = word2.c_str();
        string word3 = "";
        while(*ptr1 != '\0' || *ptr2 != '\0') {
            word3 += *ptr1;
            word3 += *ptr2;
            ptr1++;
            ptr2++;
            // Return from below
            if(*ptr1 == '\0') {
                while(*ptr2 != '\0') {
                    word3 += *ptr2;
                    ptr2++;
                } 
                return word3;
            }
            if(*ptr2 == '\0') {
                while(*ptr1 != '\0') {
                    word3 += *ptr1;
                    ptr1++;
                } 
                return word3;
            }
        }
        return word3;
    }
};
```
- Note that we could have used the `push_back()` function from the `std::string` class

### [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **correct** approach to this problem? #card 
- **Approach 1**
	1. First and foremost, we are going to have to use an **associative container** (e.g., `std::map` or `std::hash`) as we are going to want to iterate across the `std::vector` input.
		1. If the complement value (i.e., the corresponding value that needs to be found to add the *current* value to the `target`) is not found yet, we will put the *current value of the input `std::vector`* as the key and the *index* as the value. 
		2. Continue iterating across the input container and eventually we will find the corresponding value.
	- **Asymptotic Analysis**:
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- **Specifics**:
		- Instead of initializing a whole separate `std::vector<int> result` object, we can simply use **list initialization**.
		- Recall that if we simply want to know if a key *exists* in a map, it is better to just use count, especially since `find()` returns an iterator.

### [1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

#### Solution (C++)

What is the optimal approach to this problem? #card 
**Approach 1**
1. First and foremost, we can first assert that there is a list of sub values that are **divisible** across both containers by checking if they match when they are combined in both ways. For example, `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`.  
2. From there, since we know the **gcd** is present, we can simply get the **gcdLength** of both containers length. And with **gcdLength**, we can get the actual **gcd** string.

In C++, what is dangerous about the following code?
```cpp
if(str1.append(str2) == str1.append(str2)) {
	// ...
}
```
#card 
- ! Note that the `append()` method of a string a **modifies** the caller (i.e., the `str1` in the expression `str1.append(str2)`)
	- ***Highly discouraged*** to modify modify existing variables in Boolean expressions.
^1689963399334


In the context of 2d containers, how does can one easily find the greatest common divisor of two separate containers? #card 
1. First and foremost, we can first assert that there is a list of sub values that are **divisible** across both containers by checking if they match when they are combined in both ways. For example, `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`.  
2. From there, since we know the **gcd** is present, we can simply get the **gcdLength** of both containers length. And with **gcdLength**, we can get the actual **gcd** string.
^1689963399339


How can we check that there *exists* a common divisor of two separate containers? #card 
Assert that there is a list of sub values that are **divisible** across both containers by checking if they match when they are combined in both ways. For example, `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`. 
^1689963399343

Use the `std::gcd()` from the `<numeric>` library.
^1689963399348


I am getting an error with the following  code, wrong?
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
        std::string gcd {""}; 
        if(str1 + str2 == str2 + str1) { // both strings contain multiples of the identical segment
            // atleast one divisible segment
            int gcdLength = gcd(str1.size(), str2.size());
            return str1.substr(0, gcdLength);
        }
        return gcd;
    }
};
```
The compiler error‚Ä¶
```bash
Line 12: Char 29: error: type 'std::string' (aka 'basic_string<char>') does not provide a call operator int gcdLength = gcd(str1.size(), str2.size()); ^~~ 1 error generated.
```
#card 
Note how we declare a variable called `gcd` of type `std::string` already before calling the `gcd()` function. Need to be prepend `std::` to the `gcd()` so that the compiler knows that it is of the namespace library.
^1689963399353

The `<numeric>` library.
^1689963399357

^1689963399361


What is the worst case time complexity of `gcd()` from the `<numeric>` library? #card 
$\mathcal{O}(\log m \cdot n)$

^1689963399393


When dealing with a LeetCode problem, and our problem requires us returning a container, what is something we can do to make out life easier? #card 
Well, if know the size of the container we will be returning we can initialize to the size of input immediately. For example‚Ä¶
```cpp
vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
	vector<bool> result(5, true);
}
```
^1689963399398

**Approach 1**
1. Have two pointers, `itL` and `itR`, set to the start and last element of the string.
2. Start a loop that continues till `itL` is greater than or equal to `itR`
	1. If the `itL` pointer is a vowel, proceed. If not, increment.

##### Attempt #1 (7/21/2023) ‚è≤Ô∏è 00:07:56

What does the following code mean? 
```cpp
bool itR = s.end()
```
#card
Sets the iterator `itR` to the last index of the container `s`.
^1689963399423


Is the following valid code in C++?
```cpp
std::iter_swap(*itL, *itR);
```
#card 
- No, it is not. `std::iter_swap()` can **not** swap the values derived from the dereferencing of  iterators.
- If you desire to swap the *values* (i.e., not the actual positions of the iterators), then you should just do the following...
	```cpp
	std::iter_swap(itL, itR);
	```
- If you desire to swap the actual positions of where two iterators point to, then you can call the `std::swap()` from `<utility>` library.
^1689963399428


What library is the `std::swap()` function from? #card 
It is from the `<utility>` library.

### [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

#### Solution (C++)

What is the optimal approach to this problem? #card 
**Approach 1**
1. First reverse, in place, the string (i.e., reverse the string with respect to each *character*).
2. Find each, now reversed, word by using the space as a delimiter. Do this by using the `end` iterator and the `std::find()` to set the `end` iterator to the first space after the word. Reverse it again to now make the word in order.
3. Set the `start` equal to the `end` iterator. 
	1. While the `start` iterator does not equal the end of the string, increment start to point to the second element after the first delimiter that is after a word. 
	2. Erase all, from this new start to the next not delimiter element, so we can remove all extra delimiters (i.e., spaces).
4. Trim any extra leading or trialing white spaces.

What is the time and space complexity of splitting a `std::string` into a `std::vector` of words? #card 
- Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
^1689997459037

Does C++ have mutable strings? #card
Yes.
^1689969615256

What does it mean for a programming language to have mutable strings? #card 
- Means that the elements of the string can be modified in place.
- This is in contrast to languages like Java, or Python.
^1689969615260

In  C++, how can I simply reverse the contents of a container? #card 
You can simply call use the `std::reverse()` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` library.
^1689969615265

In C++, what is the easiest, modern, way of converting a sentence that is a string to a vector of segments (that represents words)? Consider the delimiter in this case being a space. #card 
Since the delimiter is a space, we can simply insert the sentence into a `stringstream()` and then extract the contents of that `stringstream` to a word.
- We can simply use a `while()` loop, since the `stringstream` will default to using a space as a delimiter.
- For example...
```cpp
std::stringstream ss(inputSentence);
std::vector<std::words> words;
	
string word = "";
while(ss >> word) {
	words.push_back(word)
}
```
^1689969615269

What is wrong with the following code? 
```cpp
std::stringstream ss(inputSentence);
std::vector<std::words> words;
	
while(ss >> words) {
	words.push_back(words)
}
```
#card 
You need to actually extract from `ss` into a **string**. Can just simply extract it into  the vector.
^1689983870623

What is the time complexity of the `std::reverse()` algorithm? #card 
The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)$
^1689983870628

For this problem, what is the downside to going with the ‚Äúsplit first‚Äù approach? #card 
Although this makes the code more readable, this increases the space complexity of the algorithm to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, since we are having to create a copy of the initial container.
^1689983870632

Given a vector of strings, how can I, ideally using functions from the `<numeric>` or `<algorithm>` standard library, concatenate the elements into a larger string where the elements (i.e., words) are separated by strings? #card 
- You can use the `std::accumulate()` from the numeric library to add up all the container elements together (if the elements supports it, *which it should*).
- For example‚Ä¶
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric> 
#include <string>
#include <vector>
int main() {
	std::vector<std::string> words = {"Test"};
	std::string sentence;
	if (!words.empty()) {
		sentence = std::accumulate( 
			std::next(words.begin()),
			words.end(),
			words[0],
			[](const std::string& a, const std::string& b) 
			{ 
				return a + ' ' + b; 
			} 
		); 
	}
std::cout << sentence << '\n'; 
return 0; }
```
^1689989918512


What does the following code snippet do? 
```cpp
if( !words.empty()) {
	reversedS = std::accumulate(
		std::next(words.begin()),
		words.end(), words[0],
		[](const string a, const string b) {
			return a + ' ' + b;
		}
	);
}
```
Make sure to break down each argument of `std::accumulate()`.
#card 
- The first argument is means that we will start from the element *next* of `words.begin()` (i.e., the second element)
- We end our accumulation at `words.end()`
- Our initial accumulation value is the first element of words.
- The last argument is a lambda function in which we get the previous value that was accessed and the current and add it together to build our new (accumulating) result.
^1689983899295


In the following code I sent, why do we increment `start` (`start++`) first, and then find if there are any extra delimiters (i.e. spaces)? 
```cpp
auto start = s.begin();
while (start != s.end()) {
	auto end = std::find(start, s.end(), ' ');
	std::reverse(start, end);
	start = end;
	
	if (start != s.end()) {
		start++;
		auto next = std::find_if(start, s.end(), [](char c) { return c != ' '; });
		if (next != start) {
			start = s.erase(start, next);
		}
	}
}
```
Essentially, why do we have start not to the first space but the second one after a word? #card 
The reason for incrementing `start` is so that we at least leave one space.
^1689983870642

In modern C++, how can we remove all *leading* elements of a string in place? #card-reverse  
To achieve this, do the following‚Ä¶
```cpp
auto end = std::find_if_not(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c){ return std::isspace(c); });
std::erase(s.begin(), end);
```
^1689983870646

In modern C++, how can we check if a character is a space? #card 
Use the function `std::space()`. For example, `std::isspace(c)` will either return `true` or `false` depending on if `c` is a character.
^1689983870651

In modern C++, how can we remove all *trailing* elements of a string in place? #card-reverse 
To achieve this, do the following‚Ä¶

What is the easiest way to check if a pointer is not null? #card
Simply do the following‚Ä¶
```cpp
if(l1) {  // <-- Will be true if l1 is not equal to nullptr
	// ...
}
```
^1690176419662

What does the following code do?

int valAtPos = (l1 ? l1->val : 0) + (l2 ? l2->val : 0) + carry;
carry = valAtPos / 10;
valAtPos = valAtPos % 10;
```
#card 
1. Cleanly defaults to zero if `l1` or `l2` equals `nullptr`. If not, then we access each of the nodes respective `val`s.
2. `carry` is set to the *tens* digit of `valAtPos`.
3. `valAtPos` is set to the last (*ones*) digit of `valAtPos`.
 
What must I **always remember** to do when dealing with linked lists, specifically building my pointer. #card

In C++, is the `erase` method a member function of some container classes in C++ or is a generic algorithm? #card 
`erase` is a member function of some container classes such as `vector`, `deque`, and `list`.
^1690724587627

How many parameters does `erase` from the `<algorithm>` library have? #card 
Erase has **two** overloads‚Ä¶
- First overload takes a single iterator as an argument (removes a single element from the `vector`)
- Second overload takes two iterators as arguments. Removes a range of elements from the `vector`
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // Example of the first overload of the erase method
    // Remove a single element
    nums.erase(nums.begin() + 1); // nums now contains {1, 3, 4, 5}
    // Print the contents of the vector
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    // Example of the second overload of the erase method
    // Remove a range of elements
    nums.erase(nums.begin() + 1, nums.begin() + 3); // nums now contains {1, 5}
    // Print the contents of the vector
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";

- This is because the `remove()` function needs to iterate across the entire container.
^1690727104022

Does `remove` actually delete/erase values in the element? #card 
- No, all that the `remove` generic algorithm does is shift all the values that are desired to be ‚Äúremoved‚Äù to the end of a the container.
- If you want to actually remove the elements, you should call `erase` to actually remove the elements in place.
^1690727104027

^1690761141193

What is the difference between `std::lower_bound()` and `std::upper_bound()`? #card 
- `std::lower_bound()` does a binary search to find the ‚Äúclosest‚Äù value, in a sorted array, strictly **greater than or equal to** ($\geq$) a given value.

What is the difference between `std::find()` from the the `<algorithm>` and the `find()` method of `std::string`? #card 
- `std::find` is focused on finding elements in a range (in this case chars if the container is a `std::string`)
- `std::string::find` is a member function of the `std::string` class that searches for a substring or a character within a string.
	- Returns the position go the first occurrence of the substring or a character within the string, or `std:::string::npos` if no such occurrence is found.
^1690762055326


Using `std::string::find`, could you search starting in reverse to find the first space (in reverse)? #card 
- You can instead use `std::string::rfind` which is a member function that searches for the last occurrence of a character or substring within a string.
- Example‚Ä¶
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    char ch = ' ';
    std::size_t pos = str.rfind(ch);
    if (pos != std::string::npos)
        std::cout << "The last occurrence of '" << ch << "' is at position " << pos << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "The character '" << ch << "' was not found\n";

### [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/description/)

### [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description)

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** to this problem? #card 
- **Fibonacci Approach**
	- **Approach:**
		1. First, let us consider a function $W(n)$ where $n$ is the number of steps in the staircase and $W(n)$ is the function returning the number of possible ways to get to the top.
		2. Consider the base cases, we know that we can either do 1 step or a 2 step for our first move.
			1. Thus, our base case is $W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2)$
			2. Note, that this works, because the idea is that we are saying that the number of ways to climb $n$ stairs is the sum of how many ways we can climb to $n-1$ (we take 1 step first) and $n-2$ (we take 2 step first)
				- Refer to the image below for a more concrete explanation‚Ä¶
				  ![[the-vault/assets/images/Pasted image 20230801232925.png|500]]
		3. So, with that known, we recognize this as the Fibonacci Sequence (shifted to the right by 1), and we can just use the closed-form of eh Fibonacci Sequence to find our answer.
	- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(log (n))$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### Attempt #1 ‚è≤Ô∏è 99:99:99

In the context of asymptotic complexity, which is faster $\mathcal{O}(\log_{2} n)$ or $\mathcal{O}(1)$? #card 
$\mathcal{O}(\log_{2} n)$ becomes slower than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ when $n > 10$ .
Proof for when $n > 10$ then is $\log_{2} n > 1$ (i.e., function is slower)‚Ä¶
To prove mathematically, we compare both the functions directly and by comparing their growth rates‚Ä¶
$$
\displaylines{
f(n) = \log_{2} n \\
g(n) = 1
}
$$
‚Ä¶so at $n = 10$, we find that‚Ä¶
$$
\displaylines{
f(n) = \log_{2} 10 \\
f(n) ‚âà 2.30259 \\
\dots \\
g(n) = 1
\\dots \\
f(n) > g(n)
}
$$
‚Ä¶now lets compare the growth rates and show that $O(\log_{2} n)$ will never become fast that $O(1)$ past that point‚Ä¶
$$
\displaylines{
\frac{df}{dn} = \frac{1}{n \log(n)} \\
\dots \\
\frac{dg}{dn} = 0 \\
}
$$
So as we see, the growth rate of that $O(\log_{2} n)$ is will never become faster than $O(1)$ past the point of 10 for at ten $f(n)$ becomes greater and has a faster growth rate.

^1690951200228

When we talk about binary search having time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$, do we mean natural log (i.e., $\ln$) or do we mean $\log_{10}$? #card 
Neither, in the context of computer science and algorithm analysis the base is typically 2. 
- This is because in computer science, specifically binary search , we divide the problem siz in half at each step, which corresponds to a logarithm base 2.

- The formula for the sum of the first $n$ of an arithmetic series is‚Ä¶
	- $S_{n} = \frac{n}{2} * (a_{1} + a_{n})$

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <numeric>
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        // Need to choose what fibonacci number we want.
        auto phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2;
        auto psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2;
        auto numerator = pow(phi,n) - pow(psi,n);
        auto denominator = sqrt(5);
        return floor(numerator/denominator);
    }
};
```
- While the code is valid, for the purposes of this problem, the logic is wrong.
- Recall that, in the context of the stair climbing problem, the number of ways to blimb `n` stairs corresponds to the `(n+1)`th Fibonacci problem, not the `n`th. 
	- This is because of the base cases‚Ä¶
		- If there is only 1 step, there is only one way. Which works‚Ä¶ ‚úÖ
		- However, if there are 2 steps, that means there are two ways (1step + 1step and 2step). This does not work if we have it set to just the `n`th Fibonacci value cause that is 1, not the necessary 2 we need.
	- As such, we need to shift our mapping to the Fibonacci Sequence by 1 to the right (i.e., `n+1`)

What are the properties of *Greedy* algorithms? #card 


What are the properties of *Dynamic Programming* algorithms? #card 
1. **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be divided into subproblems which are reused several times. The optimal solution of the original problem can be obtained by combining the solutions of these overlapping subproblems.
2. **Optimal Substructure:** The solution to the problem can be built from the optimal solutions to its subproblems. This property means that we can construct a globally optimal solution from local optima.
3. **Memoization or Tabulation:** Dynamic programming algorithms typically employ memoization or tabulation techniques to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. This helps in avoiding recalculations and saves time.
4. **Ordering:** Dynamic programming solutions usually follow some kind of ordering, whether it's left-to-right, bottom-up, top-down, or any other order that makes sense for the problem. The order must be such that the solution to a problem depends only on the problems that have already been solved.
5. **Trade-off between time and space:** Dynamic programming reduces time complexity by increasing space complexity. It trades a higher space usage for faster running times.
6. **Deterministic:** DP problems must have deterministic solutions. The solution for each subproblem remains the same and does not change over time.
7. **Polynomial complexity:** With dynamic programming, many problems that could potentially have exponential complexity can often be solved in polynomial time.

Time complexity‚Ä¶ $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
^1690970881264

How is the infamous Fibonacci problem an example of how *Dynamic Programming* can solve this problem? #card
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- `Fib(0) = 0`
- `Fib(1) = 1`
- `Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)` for `n > 1`
- A naive recursive solution to compute `Fib(n)` would be:
```python
def fib(n):    
	if n <= 1:       
		return n    
	else:       
		return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`
```
- However, this naive recursive solution has exponential time complexity, as it performs a large amount of repeated computation. For example, `fib(4)` would recursively compute `fib(3)` and `fib(2)`, but then `fib(3)` would again recursively compute `fib(2)`. This is a lot of redundant work.
- This is where dynamic programming can be applied. Let's transform this solution into a dynamic programming solution and analyze how it satisfies the properties listed:
	1. **Overlapping Subproblems:** The naive recursive solution recalculates `Fib(n-2)` even though it was already computed while calculating `Fib(n-1)`. This clearly shows that the subproblems overlap.
	2. **Optimal Substructure:** The Fibonacci number `Fib(n)` is the sum of `Fib(n-1)` and `Fib(n-2)`. Hence, we can obtain the solution to the problem from the solutions to its subproblems.
	3. **Memoization or Tabulation:** We can store the results of the subproblems in an array and reuse them when needed, instead of recalculating them. This technique is known as memoization.
	4. **Ordering:** We can solve the problem in an ordered manner ‚Äì specifically, bottom-up, starting from the smallest subproblem (`Fib(0)` and `Fib(1)`) and building up to the original problem (`Fib(n)`).
	5. **Trade-off between time and space:** By storing the results of each subproblem, we use more space. However, this also allows us to reduce the time complexity from exponential to linear.
	6. **Deterministic:** For a given input `n`, the output of `Fib(n)` will always be the same.
	7. **Polynomial complexity:** The dynamic programming solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is polynomial.
- Here's the dynamic programming solution to compute `Fib(n)`:
```python
def fib(n):    
# Declare an array to store Fibonacci numbers.
	f = [0, 1] + [0]*(n-1)      # Calculate Fibonacci numbers from 2 to n
	for i in range(2, n+1):         
		f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]     
	
	return f[n]
```
- The above solution initializes an array of size `n+1`, and then iteratively computes each Fibonacci number from 2 to `n`. The result is stored in `f[n]` and returned at the end. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the naive recursive solution for large values of `n`.

In the context of the **maximum subarray problem**, what does an **empty subarray** mean? #card 
- Its means literally just an empty array `[ ]`; the sum of an empty subarray is zero.
- For example, consider the array $[-1, -2, -3]$
	- If we could **not** return an empty array, then the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù subarray of this problem would be $[-1]$
	- Now, if we **can** return an empty array, then the maximum subarray would be the empty subarray.

        best_sum = max(best_sum, current_sum)
    return best_sum
```
^1690974873332

Is Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm considered a *Greedy* or *Dynamic Programming* algorithm? #card 
- Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm unfortunately does not fit neatly into either camp.
- It has properties of both.
^1690968808545

In Kadane‚Äôs algorithm, when do we update the starting index of our subarray? In other words, when do we reset the beginning of our subarray? How would we keep track of the starting index? #card 
- In the original algorithm, the starting index of the subarray is not being tracked. However, if you want to track the starting index of the subarray, you can do so by adding a variable¬†`start_index`¬†and updating it whenever¬†`current_sum`¬†is reset to¬†`x`. Here‚Äôs an example:
```python
def max_subarray(numbers):
    """Find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray."""
    best_sum = -infinity
    current_sum = 0
    start_index = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(numbers):
        if x > current_sum + x:
            current_sum = x
            start_index = i
        else:
            current_sum += x
        best_sum = max(best_sum, current_sum)
    return best_sum, start_index
```
- In this example,¬†`start_index`¬†is updated whenever¬†`current_sum`¬†is reset to¬†`x`, which means that a new subarray with a larger sum has been found. This happens when the previous subarray has a negative sum and adding it to the current element¬†`x`¬†would result in a smaller sum than¬†`x`¬†itself. In this case, it‚Äôs better to start a new subarray at the current index¬†`i`. So, to answer your question, we update the starting index of our subarray when we reset¬†`current_sum`¬†to¬†`x`.
^1690974873337

In Kadane‚Äôs algorithm, when do we update the ending index of our subarray? In other words, how would keep track of the ending index? #card 
You can also track the ending position of the subarray by adding another variable `end_index` and updating it whenever `best_sum` is updated. Here‚Äôs an example:
```python
def max_subarray(numbers):
    """Find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray."""
    best_sum = -infinity
    current_sum = 0
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(numbers):
        if x > current_sum + x:
            current_sum = x
            start_index = i
        else:
            current_sum += x
        if current_sum > best_sum:
            best_sum = current_sum
            end_index = i
    return best_sum, start_index, end_index
```
In this example, `end_index` is updated whenever `best_sum` is updated, which means that the current subarray has a larger sum than the previous best subarray. The ending position of the subarray is the current index `i`. So, to answer your question, we update the ending index of our subarray when we update `best_sum`.
