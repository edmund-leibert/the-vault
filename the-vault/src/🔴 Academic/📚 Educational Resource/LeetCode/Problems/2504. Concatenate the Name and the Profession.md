###### Notes

Ôπá<br>
How do you get the first char of a string in SQL Server?

#card 

In SQL Server, you can use the `LEFT` function to get the first character of a string. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT LEFT(your_column, 1) AS first_char
FROM your_table;
```

In this SQL statement, `your_column` should be replaced with the name of the column that contains the string, and `your_table` should be replaced with the name of your table. The `LEFT` function will return the first character of each string in `your_column`. The `AS` keyword is used to rename the output column as `first_char`. If you want to use a different name for the output column, you can replace `first_char` with your preferred name.

Ôπá<br>
How do you get the last char of a string in SQL Server?

#card 

In SQL Server, you can use the `RIGHT` and `LEN` functions to get the last character of a string. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT RIGHT(your_column, 1) AS last_char
FROM your_table;
```

In this SQL statement, `your_column` should be replaced with the name of the column that contains the string, and `your_table` should be replaced with the name of your table. The `RIGHT` function will return the last character of each string in `your_column`. The `AS` keyword is used to rename the output column as `last_char`. If you want to use a different name for the output column, you can replace `last_char` with your preferred name.

Ôπá<br>
How do I get the length of a string in SQL Server?

#card 

In SQL Server, you can use the `LEN` function to get the length of a string. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT LEN(your_column) AS string_length
FROM your_table;
```

In this SQL statement, `your_column` should be replaced with the name of the column that contains the string, and `your_table` should be replaced with the name of your table. The `LEN` function will return the length of each string in `your_column`. The `AS` keyword is used to rename the output column as `string_length`. If you want to use a different name for the output column, you can replace `string_length` with your preferred name.

Ôπá<br>
How do you get the first $n$ chars of a string in SQL Server?

#card 

In SQL Server, you can use the `LEFT` function to get the first `n` characters of a string. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT LEFT(your_column, n) AS first_n_chars
FROM your_table;
```

In this SQL statement, `your_column` should be replaced with the name of the column that contains the string, and `your_table` should be replaced with the name of your table. `n` should be replaced with the number of characters you want to extract from the beginning of each string in `your_column`. The `LEFT` function will return the first `n` characters of each string in `your_column`. The `AS` keyword is used to rename the output column as `first_n_chars`. If you want to use a different name for the output column, you can replace `first_n_chars` with your preferred name.
