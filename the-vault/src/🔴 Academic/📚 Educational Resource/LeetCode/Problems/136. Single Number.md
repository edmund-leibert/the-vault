What is the XOR operator in mathematics? What does it do?

#anki-card 

The XOR (exclusive OR) operator is a logical operation in mathematics. It yields true if exactly one (but not both) of two conditions is true.

In other words, XOR compares two inputs and returns true if the inputs differ (one is true, one is false). If the inputs are the same, the output is false [3](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/xor). This is why it’s called “exclusive OR” - it excludes the case where both operands are true [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or).

Here’s an example with a truth table:

|Input A|Input B|A XOR B|
|---|---|---|
|False|False|False|
|False|True|True|
|True|False|True|
|True|True|False|

This table shows that the XOR operation outputs true whenever the inputs differ [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or).

In the context of computer science, XOR is often thought of as addition modulo 2 [2](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html). For multiple arguments, XOR is defined to be true if an odd number of its arguments are true, and false otherwise [2](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html).

How can XOR be used to find a unique number in an array?

#anki-card 

 By XORing all the numbers together, any number that appears twice will cancel out to $0$ (because $a \oplus a=0$), and the result will be the number that appears only once (because $0 \oplus b=b$).

What does the symbol $\oplus$ mean? 

#anki-card 

The XOR (exclusive OR) operator is a binary operator that takes two bits and returns 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1, otherwise it returns 0.

What does the `^=` operator mean in Python and C++?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

**`^=` (Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator)**: In both Python [1](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) and C++, the `^=` operator is a compound assignment operator that performs a bitwise XOR operation on the value of the variable and the value on the right, and then assigns the result back to the variable. 
- For example, if `a = 5` (in binary `0101`) and `b = 3` (in binary `0011`), then `a ^= b` would result in `a` being `6` (in binary `0110`), because `0101 XOR 0011 = 0110`.
