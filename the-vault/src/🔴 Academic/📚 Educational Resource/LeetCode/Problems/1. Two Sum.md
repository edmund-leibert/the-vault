Under what conditions can the time complexity for operations in a `std::unordered_map` become linear $\mathcal{O}(n)$?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

When is it generally beneficial to use `std::unordered_map` over `std::map` in C++?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

When optimizing for speed and you have a good hash function that minimizes the likelihood of collisions, making the average case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ more likely.

﹇<br>
Why might one choose `std::map` over `std::unordered_map` for specific scenarios?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

When you need sorted key order, or when you want to ensure worst-case performance of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ for operations regardless of hash collisions.

If you are working with a small and finite set of values, can you generally expect `std::unordered_map` operations to have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time complexity?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, with a small and finite set of values, the chances for hash collisions are reduced, making $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time complexity more likely for `std::unordered_map` operations. However, the quality of the hash function and the load factor can still affect performance.

Is the following approach valid?

```cpp
// target = a + b
// a = target - b
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        map<int,int> numMap; // value, index

        vector<int> ans;

        for(int i {0}; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if(numMap.find(complement) == numMap.end()) {
                numMap[nums[i]] = i;
            }
            else { // We have a found the complemet
                ans.push_back(i);
                ans.push_back(numMap[complement]);
                return ans;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

While the above approach will compile and is logically correct, it is not _entirely_ optimal. 
- Given the relatively small maximum size for `nums` (recall that one of the **constraints** for the problem is `2 <= nums.length <= 104`), we can safely use `std::unordered_map` instead to achieve a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ worst case time complexity.
- Also, we can simply just return our answer directly instead of predeclaring an `ans` vector at the start.

Taking into account the suggestions above, here is a more “optimal” solution…

```cpp
// target = a + b
// a = target - b
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {

public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int> numMap; // value, index

        for(int i {0}; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if(numMap.find(complement) == numMap.end()) {
                numMap[nums[i]] = i;
            }
            else { // We have a found the complemet
                return {i, numMap[complement]};
            }
        }

        return {};
    }
};
```

In C++, can you initialize a `std::vector` without pre-declaring its size, using curly braces (`{}`)?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, you can initialize a `std::vector` without pre-declaring its size by using list initialization with curly braces. 

For example: 
```cpp
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};

In Python, what is the equivalent of the `.find()` method for dictionaries that is commonly used in C++?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

The equivalent is using the `in` keyword to check for the existence of a key, or using `.get(key, default_value)` to retrieve the value associated with a key. `.get()` will return `None` or the specified default value if the key is not found.

In Python, dictionaries don't have a `.find()` method like C++ maps. However, you can use the `in` keyword to check if a key exists in a dictionary. If you want to retrieve the value for a given key, you can use `.get()` which returns `None` if the key is not found, or you can specify a default value.

Here are some examples:

- Using `in` to check for a key:
```python
if key in my_dict:
print("Key exists.")
```

- Using `.get()` to retrieve a value or `None`:
```python
value = my_dict.get(key)
```

- Using `.get()` with a default value:
```python
value = my_dict.get(key, "default_value")
```

How do you declare a **dictionary** in Python 3?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

In Python 3, you can declare a dictionary using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons. You can also use the `dict()` constructor. Here are some examples:

1. Using curly braces:
```python
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

2. Using the `dict()` constructor:
```python
my_dict = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
```

3. An empty dictionary:
```python
my_dict = {}
```

In C#, what is the equivalent of a **map** in C++? 

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

The equivalent of a map in C++ is a `Dictionary` in C#.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare and initialize a Dictionary
        Dictionary<string, int> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();

        // Adding key-value pairs
        myDictionary.Add("apple", 1);
        myDictionary.Add("banana", 2);
        myDictionary.Add("cherry", 3);

        // Another way to add or update a key-value pair
        myDictionary["apple"] = 1;

        // Access a value by key
        int value = myDictionary["apple"];

        Console.WriteLine(value);  // Output will be 1
    }
}
```

How do you declare and initialize a `Dictionary` in C#?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp

Can you enumerate across `Dictionary` in C# like in Python?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp  

Yes, you can enumerate through a `Dictionary` in C# similarly to how you would in Python. The `Dictionary` type provides different ways to iterate through its elements.

Here are a few methods:

1. **Iterate through Keys and Values:**
```csharp
foreach (KeyValuePair<string, int> kvp in myDictionary)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"Key: {kvp.Key}, Value: {kvp.Value}");
}
```

2. **Iterate through Keys only:**
```csharp
foreach (string key in myDictionary.Keys)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"Key: {key}");
}
```

3. **Iterate through Values only:**
```csharp
foreach (int value in myDictionary.Values)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"Value: {value}");
}
```

﹇<br>
Can you enumerate across an `int[]` array in C#?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

Yes, you can enumerate through an `int[]` array in C# using a `foreach` loop, similar to Python's `for` loop over a list. Here's how you do it:

```csharp
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

foreach (int item in myArray)
{
    Console.WriteLine(item);
}
```

This will output each element in the array, one per line.

You can also use a traditional `for` loop if you need the index:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; ++i)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Index: {i}, Value: {myArray[i]}");
}
```

<br>﹈<br>^1694965558686



﹇<br>
Is there a built-in `enumerate` function like in Python for C#? 

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

C# doesn’t have a built-in `enumerate` function like Python, which allows you to iterate through items in a collection while also keeping track of the index. 

However, you can easily replicate this functionality using a `for` loop and the `Length` property for arrays or the `Count` property for collections like `List<T>`.

Here's an example using a `for` loop with an array:

```csharp
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Index: {i}, Value: {myArray[i]}");
}
```

You can also use LINQ to achieve similar functionality, though it might be a bit more verbose:

```csharp
using System.Linq;

// ...

int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
foreach (var (item, index) in myArray.Select((value, index) => (value, index)))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Index: {index}, Value: {item}");
}
```

How can I access the size of a container in C#?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

The way you access the size of a container in C# varies depending on the type of the container. Here are some common cases:

1. **Array**: Use the `Length` property.
```csharp
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3};
int size = myArray.Length;
```

2. **List**: Use the `Count` property.
```csharp
List<int> myList = new List<int> {1, 2, 3};
int size = myList.Count;
```

3. **Dictionary**: Use the `Count` property.
```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();
myDictionary.Add("one", 1);
int size = myDictionary.Count;
```

4. **Collection interfaces** like `ICollection` or `IList`: Use the `Count` property.
```csharp
ICollection<int> myCollection = new List<int> {1, 2, 3};
int size = myCollection.Count;
```

Can you use collection initializers in C# to initialize lists, dictionaries, and other collections in a manner similar to list initialization in C++?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

Yes, you can use collection initializers in C# to initialize lists, dictionaries, and other collections in a manner similar to list initialization in C++. For example:

1. **List Initialization**
```csharp
List<int> myList = new List<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

2. **Dictionary Initialization**
```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>
{
	{"one", 1},
	{"two", 2},
	{"three", 3}
};
```

3. **Array Initialization**
```csharp
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

Note that the collection initializers in C# are not exactly the same as list initialization in C++ but serve a similar purpose of making the code more readable and concise.

Does C# support direct brace initialization?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp  

The direct brace initialization syntax for single variables, like…
```cpp
int x{2};
``` 
…in C++, is not available in C#. In C#, you would typically use the assignment operator for primitive types:

```csharp
int x = 2;
```

C# does not offer the brace initialization syntax for primitives, but it does have various ways to initialize objects and collections as previously mentioned.

Is the following code valid?

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Solution {
    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Dictionary<int, int> numMap;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            if(numMap.find(target - nums[i]) == None) {
                numMap[nums[i]] = i;
            }
            else {
                return {i, nums[i]};
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
}
```

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp  

Several issues exist in your C# code. Let's go through them:

1. `numMap` is declared but not initialized. You should initialize it before using it.

1. The `find` method does not exist in C# for dictionaries; use `ContainsKey` instead.

2. `None` is not a keyword in C#; you should use `null`.

3. Arrays in C# don't support Python-style dynamic list initialization with 

	```csharp
	{}
	```

	directly in a `return` statement. Use the following instead…
	
	```csharp
	new int[] {...} 
	```

1. Remember that 

	```csharp
	return {};
	```

	 is also not valid for the same reason as point 4.

6. Instead of returning `i` and `nums[i]`, you should return `i` and the value from `numMap` which corresponds to the index of the matching number.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Solution {
    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Dictionary<int, int> numMap = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            if(!numMap.ContainsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                numMap[nums[i]] = i;
            }
            else {
                return new int[] {i, numMap[target - nums[i]]};
            }
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
