## :TiNotes: Description

Ôπá<br>
As of Apr. 11, 2024 01:59:41 AM, in C++, can you remove elements in a `vector<int>` directly, without resizing the vector?

#anki-card 

In C++, when you want to remove elements from a `std::vector<int>`, the vector is resized automatically. This is because a `std::vector` in C++ is a dynamic array, and its size changes as elements are added or removed.

The `std::vector::erase` function is commonly used to remove elements from a vector. It removes elements from the vector and automatically reduces the size of the vector. Here is an example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
nums.erase(nums.begin() + 2);  // This will remove the third element (value 3)
```

In your case, if you want to remove an element without resizing the vector, you could replace the element with a specific value that indicates it is ‚Äúremoved‚Äù or ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù. However, this depends on the logic of your program and whether such a value exists that won‚Äôt interfere with the rest of your program.

Remember, even though the vector‚Äôs size remains the same in this case, the ‚Äúeffective size‚Äù (number of valid elements) is reduced. You would need to handle this in your code logic. For example:

```cpp
std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
nums[2] = -1;  // This will mark the third element as "removed" by setting it to -1
```

In this example, `-1` is used as the ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù marker. You would then need to check for this value in any code that processes this vector.

Please note that this is not a common practice and it‚Äôs usually better to actually remove the element and let the vector resize. This keeps the code cleaner and less prone to errors. If preserving the original size is important, consider using a different data structure that allows for removal without resizing, such as a linked list (`stdlist` in C++).
