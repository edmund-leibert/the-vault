#### Solution (SQL Server)

Ôπá<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

#card 

**Approach #1**: Simple `LEFT JOIN` and get all rows `WHERE` the `customerId` is `NULL` ‚úÖ

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
    ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL
```

###### Notes

Ôπá<br>
What are the alternative approaches for finding records in one table that don't have corresponding records in another table in SQL Server? 

#card-reverse

1. Using `LEFT JOIN` with `WHERE column IS NULL`: This method performs a `LEFT JOIN` and then filters out the records that have corresponding records in the right table.
2. Using `NOT EXISTS`: This method uses a subquery to check for the absence of corresponding records in the right table. This is also known as an *ANTI JOIN* clause.

```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.customerId = c.id
)
```

In this query, for each customer in the `Customers` table, the subquery checks the `Orders` table to see if an order exists for that customer. If no such order exists (`NOT EXISTS`), then that customer's name will be included in the result set.

Ôπá<br>
What factors affect the efficiency of `LEFT JOIN` versus `NOT EXISTS` subquery in SQL Server?

#card

1. **Query Optimizer**: SQL Server's query optimizer often transforms subqueries and joins into similar operations, making them equally efficient in many cases.
2. **Indexes**: Proper indexing can make both approaches fast, but `NOT EXISTS` may make more effective use of indexes.
3. **Readability**: `LEFT JOIN` is often easier to read, while `NOT EXISTS` is more semantically clear for anti-joins.
4. **Semantics**: `NOT EXISTS` explicitly states the intent to find records that don't exist in another table, which can make the query's purpose clearer.

Ôπá<br>
What does `SELECT 1` commonly signify in SQL queries?

#card

`SELECT 1` is often used to return a constant value of $1$ for each row in a subquery. It is frequently employed in scenarios like `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` where the actual data from the row is not needed, only the presence or absence of a row matching the given conditions.

For example, in a `NOT EXISTS` subquery, `SELECT 1` will return 1 if a row matching the condition is found. The outer query then knows that a corresponding row exists, without needing any additional data from that row.

Here's a quick example:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.EmployeeId = e.Id
)
```

In this example, the `SELECT 1` is used to indicate the existence of a corresponding order for each employee. If `SELECT 1` returns a row, then the `NOT EXISTS` condition is false, and the employee is not included in the final result. If `SELECT 1` does not return a row, the `NOT EXISTS` condition is true, and the employee is included in the final result.

What are the differences between `EXISTS` and `IN` in SQL Server?

#card

1. Purpose: `EXISTS` checks for the existence of rows, while `IN` filters against a list of values.
2. Performance: `EXISTS` is often more efficient as it stops processing once a match is found, whereas `IN` checks against all values in a list.
3. Null Handling: `EXISTS` handles NULLs well, but `IN` can give unexpected results with NULLs.
4. Subquery Results: `EXISTS` ignores the values returned by the subquery, while `IN` explicitly checks against them.
5. Semantics: `EXISTS` is clearer when checking existence, and `IN` is clearer when comparing against a set of known values.

<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
Does SQL Server support the clause `ANTI JOIN`?

#card

SQL Server does not have an explicit `ANTI JOIN` keyword. However, anti-join functionality can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` combined with a `WHERE` clause to filter out non-null records or by using `NOT EXISTS`.
