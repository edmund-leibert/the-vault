Is the following code valid?

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
        p1.x AS 'x1',
        p2.x AS 'x2',
        abs(p1.x - p2.x) AS 'shortest'
    FROM Point p1
    JOIN Point p2
    ORDER BY shortest ASC
)
SELECT
    shortest AS 'shortest'
FROM CTE
TOP 1
```

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

While the code will not result in a error from the database engine, it is not _logically_ correct and _not_ optimal.

The issue with your SQL Server solution is that you‚Äôre trying to join the `Point` table with itself without specifying a join condition. This will result in a Cartesian product, which is not what you want.

Additionally, the `ORDER BY` clause is not valid in the `FROM` clause where you‚Äôve placed it. It should be in the `SELECT` statement.

Here‚Äôs a corrected version of your query:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
        p1.x AS 'x1',
        p2.x AS 'x2',
        ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS 'shortest'
    FROM Point p1
    JOIN Point p2
    ON p1.x <> p2.x
)
SELECT
	shortest AS 'shortest'
FROM 
	CTE
ORDER BY shortest ASC
TOP 1
```

This query first creates a Cartesian product of the `Point` table with itself, excluding pairs of the same points. It then selects the pair with the smallest distance.

However, this solution is not efficient because it computes the distance between every pair of points. If the `Point` table is ordered in ascending order, you can optimize your solution by only computing the distance between adjacent points:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
        LAG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) as 'x1',
        x as 'x2',
        ABS(LAG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) - x) as 'shortest'
    FROM Point
)
SELECT 
	shortest AS 'shortest'
FROM 
	CTE
WHERE 
	shortest IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY shortest ASC
TOP 1
```

This query uses the `LAG()` function to access data from the previous row and compute the distance to the current row. It then selects the smallest distance. Note that we exclude null distances which occur for the first point where there is no previous point.

If this problem was modified so that we had the guarantee that the input table was sorted, could we develop a more efficient approach than a Cartesian product?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

Yes. If the `Point` table is sorted in ascending order, you can use the `LAG()` function to compute the distance between adjacent points. This is more efficient because it only requires one pass over the data.

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
        LAG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) as 'x1',
        x as 'x2',
        ABS(LAG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) - x) as 'shortest'
    FROM Point
)
SELECT 
	shortest AS 'shortest'
FROM
	CTE
WHERE
	shortest IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY shortest ASC
TOP 1
```

However, if the `Point` table is not sorted, you would need to use a Cartesian product to compute the distance between every pair of points. This is less efficient because it requires multiple passes over the data and computes many more distances. But it‚Äôs necessary to ensure that you find the shortest distance.

Remember, SQL doesn‚Äôt guarantee an order of rows unless you explicitly sort them with an `ORDER BY` clause. So even if the input appears to be sorted, it‚Äôs a good practice to use `ORDER BY` when you need sorted data.

Remember, SQL doesn‚Äôt {1:guarantee an order of rows} unless you {1:explicitly sort them with an `ORDER BY` clause}. So even if the input {1:appears to be sorted}, it‚Äôs a good practice to use {1:`ORDER BY`} when you need {1:sorted data}.

What is _critically_ important to consider when using window functions? Specifically, the `LAG` and `LEAD` functions?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

When using window functions like `LAG()` and `LEAD()`, it‚Äôs important to consider NULL results. These functions return NULL for the first row (in case of `LAG()`) or the last row (in case of `LEAD()`) because there is no previous or next row, respectively.

For example, if you‚Äôre calculating the difference between the current row and the previous row, the first row will have a NULL difference because there is no previous row. It‚Äôs important to handle these NULL values appropriately in your queries, either by filtering them out with a `WHERE` clause or replacing them with a default value using the `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` functions.

What are **aggregate window functions**?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

**Aggregate Window Functions**: These functions operate on multiple rows and return a single aggregated value for each row. Examples include `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc. They are similar to regular aggregate functions, but unlike regular aggregate functions, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row.

Remember, all these window functions use the `OVER()` clause to define the window of rows they operate on. The window can be defined using the `PARTITION BY` clause (to divide the result set into partitions), the `ORDER BY` clause (to sort the rows within each partition), and the `ROWS` or `RANGE` clause (to further limit the rows within the partition).

What are **ranking window functions**?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

**Ranking Window Functions**: These functions rank each row of a partition in a table. Examples include `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `NTILE()`. They are used to rank items in a specific window of a result set.

Remember, all these window functions use the `OVER()` clause to define the window of rows they operate on. The window can be defined using the `PARTITION BY` clause (to divide the result set into partitions), the `ORDER BY` clause (to sort the rows within each partition), and the `ROWS` or `RANGE` clause (to further limit the rows within the partition).

What are **value window functions**?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

**Value Window Functions**: These functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row. Examples include `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `FIRST_VALUE()`, and `LAST_VALUE()`. They are used to compare values between different rows in the same result set.

Remember, all these window functions use the `OVER()` clause to define the window of rows they operate on. The window can be defined using the `PARTITION BY` clause (to divide the result set into partitions), the `ORDER BY` clause (to sort the rows within each partition), and the `ROWS` or `RANGE` clause (to further limit the rows within the partition).

The `FIRST_VALUE()` window function returns the value of a specified column from the first row within the window defined by the `OVER()` clause.

In what sequence are `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, and `TOP` clauses executed in an SQL query?

#card-reverse #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

1. The `SELECT` clause identifies what columns to select, but doesn't actually retrieve the data at this point.
2. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the data according to the specified column(s).
3. The `TOP` clause then limits the result set to the first N rows based on the sorted data.

In the context of `TOP` and `ORDER BY` together, `ORDER BY` gets applied first to sort the data, and then `TOP` takes the first N rows from that sorted set.

That is why it is recommended to _not_ put `TOP` in the `SELECT` clause but instead place it _after_ the `ORDER BY`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1694561660566

That is why it is recommended to _not_ put `TOP` in the {1:`SELECT`} clause but instead place it _after_ the {2:`ORDER BY`} clause.
