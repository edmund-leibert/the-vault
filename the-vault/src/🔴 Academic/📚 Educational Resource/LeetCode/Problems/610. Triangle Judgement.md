### 610. Triangle Judgement

> [!info]+ Where can the problem be found?
> The problem can be found here: [610. Triangle Judgement](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/)

#### Solution (SQL Server)

﹇<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

#card 

[**Approach**: Using `case...when...`](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/editorial/)

**Intuition**

In Math, three segments can form a triangle only if the sum of any of the two segments is larger than the third one.  
(In other words, the subtraction of any of the two segments are smaller than the third one.)

So, we can use this knowledge to judge with the help of the MySQL control statements [`case...when...`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/case.html).

**Implementation**

**SQL Server**
```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN 
            (t.x + t.y > t.z) AND
            (t.z + t.x > t.y) AND
            (t.y + t.z > t.x)
        THEN
            'Yes'
        ELSE
            'No'
    END AS 'triangle'
FROM 
    triangle t
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
In SQL Server, what is the template for the `CASE` statement?

#card 

The `CASE` statement in SQL Server is a way of handling if-then logic. It’s used to create different outputs based on conditions. Here’s the syntax:

```sql
CASE 
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1 
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2 
    ...
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN 
    ELSE default_result 
END
```

[In this syntax](about:blank#)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/case-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16):

- `condition1`, `condition2`, …, `conditionN` are the conditions that are checked in the order they are written.
- `result1`, `result2`, …, `resultN` are the results that are returned when the corresponding conditions are met.
- `default_result` is the result that is returned if none of the conditions are met. [This is optional](about:blank#)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/case-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

Here’s an example:

```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE 
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
```

In this example, a new column `QuantityText` is created based on the quantity. If the quantity is greater than 30, it returns ‘The quantity is greater than 30’. If the quantity equals 30, it returns ‘The quantity is 30’. [Otherwise, it returns 'The quantity is under 30’](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp).

﹇<br>
Can a `CASE` clause be used to create a new column in a result set?

#card 

Yes, the result of a `CASE` clause can be used to create a new column in your result set. The new column will contain values based on the conditions specified in the `CASE` clause. Here’s an example:

```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE 
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'High'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
END AS QuantityLevel
FROM OrderDetails;
```

In this example, a new column `QuantityLevel` is created. If the quantity is greater than 30, ‘High’ is returned in the `QuantityLevel` column. If the quantity equals 30, ‘Medium’ is returned. Otherwise, ‘Low’ is returned. This can be very useful for categorizing or grouping data based on specific conditions.

###### Notes

﹇<br>
What properties must _shapes_ satisfy in order to be considered a _triangle_?

#card 

1. It must have exactly three straight sides.
2. It must have exactly three angles.
3. The sum of the interior angles must equal 180 degrees.
4. Each side must be a line segment, not a curve.
5. The sides must be closed to form a polygon.
6. The shape must be two-dimensional.
7. The sides must not be collinear, meaning they cannot lie on the same straight line.

﹇<br>
What must be true for all side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ of a triangle?

#card

All side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be greater than zero $(a > 0)$, $(b > 0)$, $(c > 0)$.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1694512570997


﹇<br>
What is the Triangle Inequality Theorem?

#card-reverse 

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side $(a + b > c)$, $(a + c > b)$, $(b + c > a)$.

﹇<br>
How can you determine if a shape with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is a valid triangle?

#card

All side lengths must be greater than zero $(a > 0)$, $(b > 0)$, $(c > 0)$ and the Triangle Inequality Theorem must hold $(a + b > c)$, $(a + c > b)$, $(b + c > a)$.

﹇<br>
Can you use a `CASE` statement to create a derived column in the `SELECT` clause of an `SQL` query?

#card 

Yes, you can use a `CASE` statement in the `SELECT` clause to create a derived column based on some conditions. The `CASE` statement will evaluate the condition for each row and assign the respective value in the derived column.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1694512571014


﹇<br>
What is the purpose of using a `CASE` statement in the `SELECT` clause? 

#card 

The purpose of using a `CASE` statement in the `SELECT` clause is to create a derived column that doesn't exist in the table. The derived column is computed on-the-fly based on the conditions specified in the `CASE` statement.
