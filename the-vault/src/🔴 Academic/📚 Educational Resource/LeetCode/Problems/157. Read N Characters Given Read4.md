## :TiNotes: Description

﹇<br>
What are the parameter(s) of the API of `read4`?

#card 

The API `read4()` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Example of using the `read4()`:

```cpp
int read(char *buf, int n) {
	int copiedChars = 0, readChars = 4;
	char buf4[4];
	
	while (copiedChars < n && readChars == 4) {
		readChars = read4(buf4);
		
		for (int i = 0; i < readChars; ++i) {
			if (copiedChars == n)
				return copiedChars;
			buf[copiedChars] = buf4[i];
			++copiedChars;    
		}    
	}
	return copiedChars;
}
```

What is this type of documentation called?

```cpp
/**
* @param buf Destination buffer
* @param n   Number of characters to read
* @return    The number of actual characters read
*/
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

This kind of documentation is common in code and is known as a **docstring**. It provides a convenient way to document the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value.

The `@param` statements in the function you provided are explained as follows:

- `buf`: This is the **destination buffer** where the data will be stored. It’s usually an array or a data structure that can hold the incoming data.
- `n`: This is the **number of characters to read** from the source (like a file or another buffer). The function will attempt to read this many characters and store them in `buf`.


The `@return` statement indicates what the function returns:

- The function returns the **number of actual characters read**. This might be less than `n` if there was not enough data to read, or if there was an error during the reading process. This allows the calling code to handle these situations
