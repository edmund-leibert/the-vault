### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

#### Solution (C++)

﹇<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

#card 

**Approach 2:** The _iterative_ approach 🌟

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        // Base Cases
        if(list2 == nullptr) {
            return list1;
        }

        if(list1 == nullptr) {
            return list2;
        }

        ListNode* prehead = new ListNode(-1);

        ListNode* prev = prehead;
        while(list1 != nullptr && list2 != nullptr) {
            if(list1->val <= list2->val) {
                prev->next = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            }
            else {
                prev->next = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
            prev = prev->next;
        }

        prev->next = list1 == nullptr ? list2 : list1;

        return prehead->next;
    }
};
```

1. Check the base cases first to see if we can immediately just return `list2` or `list1`.
2. Create a `prehead` (i.e., our “dummy” pointer) to our answer list.
3. Create a `prev` node; this node will actually be modified and moved.
4. Now start a the `while` loop which will only stop when either `list1` or `list2` has reached the end. 
	1. Set `prev->next` to the node of the relevant list node.
	2. Increment said list pointer to its next node after doing the above.
	3. Always, after doing the above stuff in the loop, set `prev` to `prev->next`
5. Set `prev→next` to the rest of a list of a list; this checks for a if one list is finished before another.
6. Return `prehead->next`.

**Asymptotic Complexity**:
- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

###### Notes

﹇<br>
Generally, is it better to go with an _iterative_ approach or a _recursive_ when trying to solve linked list problems?

#card 

In general, both iterative and recursive approaches can be used to solve problems involving linked lists. However, the choice between the two approaches depends on the specific problem and the constraints of the system.

For example, an iterative approach can be more efficient in terms of space complexity because it does not create extra space on the call stack as a recursive approach does. This can be important when working with large linked lists or when memory is a constraint.

﹇<br>
What does the following snippet of code do?

```cpp
prev->next = list1 == nullptr ? list2 : list1;
```

#card 

Sets `prev->next` to either the “rest” of `list2` or `list1`. This checks for edge case of where `list1` or `list2` could be at the end before the other one.
