#### Solution (SQL Server)

Ôπá<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? Provide analysis regarding what differentiates it to other approaches/solutions.

#card 

**Approach**: Simply use `GROUP BY` with the aggregate function `MAX()`
```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- Join together ON where bike_number same and start_time > start_Time of previosu

SELECT
    b.bike_number AS 'bike_number',
    MAX(b.end_time) AS 'end_time'
FROM 
    Bikes b
GROUP BY
    b.bike_number
```

###### Notes

Ôπá<br>
What is the logical order of SQL query clauses, including window functions and conditional statements like `CASE` and `ELSE`?

#card

The logical order of SQL query clauses, including window functions and conditional statements, is as follows:
1. **FROM**: Specifies the tables, views, or joins from which to select or delete, or into which to insert rows.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on a given condition.
3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows based on one or multiple columns, enabling aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.
4. **HAVING**: Filters the groups based on the results of aggregate functions.
5. **WINDOW**: Defines window frames for window functions. A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row.
6. **SELECT**: Chooses the columns to include in the final result. This is where you'd use most of your scalar functions like `ROUND`, `CONCAT`, etc. You'd also specify your window functions here.
   - **CASE / ELSE**: Conditional logic with `CASE` and `ELSE` is typically included in this part as well, allowing you to create new columns based on conditions or calculations.
7. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the rows by one or more columns. Window functions with an `ORDER BY` inside their `OVER()` clause look at this sorting.
8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: Defines a subset of the results to be returned.

Understanding this logical order helps in planning queries, understanding query behavior, and debugging issues.
