#### Solution (SQL Server)

Ôπá<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? Provide analysis regarding what differentiates it to other approaches/solutions.

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

**Approach:** Simple `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, then use `ISNULL`

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT
    u.user_id AS 'user_id',
    u.name AS 'name',
    SUM(ISNULL(r.distance, 0)) AS 'traveled distance' 
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r
    ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.name, u.user_id
```

###### Notes

Ôπá<br>
What are all the possible _aggregate functions_ that can be used with `SELECT` after using `GROUP BY` in SQL Server?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, you can use the following aggregate functions with the `SELECT` statement after using `GROUP BY`:

1. **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
2. **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
3. **FIRST()**: Returns the first value of the selected column. _\*Not supported_
4. **LAST()**: Returns the last value of the selected column.  _\*Not supported_
5. **MAX()**: Returns the maximum value in a set of values.
6. **MIN()**: Returns the minimum value in a set of values.
7. **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
8. **GROUPING()**: Indicates whether a specified column expression in a `GROUP BY` list is aggregated or not.

Please note that `FIRST()` and `LAST()` are not supported in SQL Server. They are available in some other SQL databases like MySQL and MS Access.

Also, remember that all columns in the `SELECT` statement that are not used with an aggregate function must be listed in the `GROUP BY` clause. Otherwise, you will get an error.

What is an alternative to `FIRST()` and `LAST()` in SQL Server?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, the `FIRST()` and `LAST()` functions are not supported. However, you can achieve similar results using subqueries or window functions.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you can get the first and last values of a column using a subquery:

```sql
-- Get the first value
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY other_column
TOP 1;
 
-- Get the last value
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY other_column DESC
TOP 1;
```

In these examples, `column_name` is the name of the column for which you want to get the first or last value, `table_name` is the name of your table, and `other_column` is the column by which you want to order the data.

You can also use window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `NTILE()`. Here‚Äôs an example:

```sql
-- Get the first value
SELECT column_name
FROM (
    SELECT column_name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY other_column) as row_num
    FROM table_name
) as temp_table
WHERE row_num = 1;

-- Get the last value
SELECT column_name
FROM (
    SELECT column_name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY other_column DESC) as row_num
    FROM table_name
) as temp_table
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

In these examples, a temporary table (`temp_table`) is created with an additional column (`row_num`) that numbers each row based on the order specified in the `OVER` clause. The outer query then selects the first or last row from this temporary table. Please note that window functions are only available in SQL Server 2005 and later versions.

Ôπá<br>
In MySQL, `FIRST()` returns the first row of each group. Is there a simialr way/function to do this in SQL Server with groups made from a `GROUP BY` clause?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

No.

In SQL Server, there isn‚Äôt a direct equivalent to the `FIRST()` function in MySQL that works with the `GROUP BY` clause. However, you can achieve similar results using subqueries or the `ROW_NUMBER()` function[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41840829/using-group-by-with-first-value-and-last-value)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3800551/select-first-row-in-each-group-by-group).

Here‚Äôs an example using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT 
	t.*
FROM (
	SELECT 
		*, 
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY group_column ORDER BY sort_column) AS rn
	FROM your_table
) t
WHERE 
	t.rn = 1
```

In this query, `ROW_NUMBER()` is a window function that assigns a unique row number to each row within a partition of the result set. The `PARTITION BY` clause divides the result set into partitions (in this case, based on the `group_column`). The `ORDER BY` clause specifies the order of the rows in each partition. The outer query then selects only the first row from each partition[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41840829/using-group-by-with-first-value-and-last-value)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3800551/select-first-row-in-each-group-by-group).

Please replace `your_table`, `group_column`, and `sort_column` with your actual table name, group by column, and order by column respectively[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41840829/using-group-by-with-first-value-and-last-value)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3800551/select-first-row-in-each-group-by-group).

In MySQL, `LAST()` returns the first row of each group. Is there a simialr way/function to do this in SQL Server with groups made from a `GROUP BY` clause?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/sql 

No.

In SQL Server, there isn‚Äôt a direct equivalent to the `LAST()` function in MySQL that works with the `GROUP BY` clause. However, you can achieve similar results using subqueries or the `ROW_NUMBER()` function[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54325549/converting-an-access-last-function-into-a-sql-query)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8139016/what-is-mysql-equivalent-of-ms-access-last).

Here‚Äôs an example using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT t.*
FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY group_column ORDER BY sort_column DESC) AS rn
  FROM your_table
) t
WHERE t.rn = 1
```

In this query, `ROW_NUMBER()` is a window function that assigns a unique row number to each row within a partition of the result set.

How do you handle `NULL` values in SQL Server?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

In SQL Server, you can use the `ISNULL()` function to replace `NULL` with a specified replacement value. For example:

```sql
SELECT
	SUM(ISNULL(column_name, 0)) AS 'sum'
FROM table_name;
```

	WHEN condition2 THEN result2
	...
	WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
	ELSE result
END;
