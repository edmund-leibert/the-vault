#card 

**Official LeetCode - Database - Approach #1**: `GROUP BY` and use `MAX` function

**Algorithm**

In SQL, we can group the data using `group by` based on `emp_id` clause and use `MAX` aggregate function to find the latest salary.

In addition, because we need to return the result in ascending order of `emp_id`, we also use the `order by` clause for the `emp_id` column. Note that the `order by` sorts the values in ascending order by default, which is exactly what we want.

**Implementation**

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT
    s.emp_id AS 'emp_id',
    MAX(s.firstname) AS 'firstname',
    MAX(s.lastname) AS 'lastname',
    MAX(s.salary) AS 'salary',
    MAX(s.department_id) AS 'department_id'
FROM 
    Salary s
GROUP BY 
    s.emp_id
ORDER BY emp_id ASC
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
Unlike MySQL, must SQL Server `SELECT`statements concerning columns use aggregate functions when using the `GROUP BY` clause?

#card 

Yes, in SQL Server, when you use the `GROUP BY` clause, you must apply an aggregate function to any column in your `SELECT` statement that is not included in the `GROUP BY` clause[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

The `GROUP BY` clause groups a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns. Each subset can be viewed as a single group and summary information is returned for each group. For each group, you can apply an aggregate function such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN` to provide more information about each group[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

Here’s an example:

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) 
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

In this example, the `COUNT` function is used to find the number of employees in each department[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

Please note that if you want to retrieve all the columns from a table without applying an aggregate function, you would not use a `GROUP BY` clause[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). Instead, you might use a `SELECT * FROM table_name` statement[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).
