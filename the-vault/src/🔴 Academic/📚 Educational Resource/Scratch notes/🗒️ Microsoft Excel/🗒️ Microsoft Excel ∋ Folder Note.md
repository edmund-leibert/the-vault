In Microsoft Office, specifically Excel, what is the shortcut to insert *both* the current date and time into a cell?

In Microsoft Excel, you can insert the current date and time into a cell using a combination of keyboard shortcuts. Hereâ€™s how you do it:

1. Select the cell where you want to insert the current date and time.
2. Press `Ctrl+;` (semi-colon) to insert the current date.
3. Press `Space` to add a space after the date.
4. [Press `Ctrl+Shift+;` (semi-colon) to insert the current time](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-b5663451-10b0-40ab-9e71-6b0ce5768138)[1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-b5663451-10b0-40ab-9e71-6b0ce5768138).

Please note that this will insert a static date and time, meaning it wonâ€™t change when the worksheet is recalculated or opened. [If you want the date and time to update dynamically, you can use the `TODAY()` and `NOW()` functions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-b5663451-10b0-40ab-9e71-6b0ce5768138)[1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-b5663451-10b0-40ab-9e71-6b0ce5768138).
