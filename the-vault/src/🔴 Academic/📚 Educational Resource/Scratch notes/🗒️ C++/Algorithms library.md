In C++, what exactly is a **constrained algorithm**?

#card 

In C++, constrained algorithms are a feature introduced in C++20. They provide constrained versions of most algorithms in the namespace `std::ranges`¹. In these algorithms, a range can be specified as either an iterator-sentinel pair or as a single range argument¹. They also support projections and pointer-to-member callables¹. This means that you can use these algorithms with a wider variety of data types and structures, making your code more flexible and reusable.

What are the characteristics of constrained algorithm? Specifically, what makes an algorithm constrained vs. not constrained?

#card 

Constrained algorithms in C++20 are a new feature that provide more flexibility and functionality compared to the traditional algorithms in the Standard Template Library (STL). Here are some characteristics that make an algorithm constrained:

1. **Range Specification**: In constrained algorithms, a range can be specified as either an iterator-sentinel pair or as a single range argument \[[[#^ConstrainedAlgorithms202023-1|1]]\]. This allows for more flexibility when working with different data structures.
2. **Support for Projections and Pointer-to-Member Callables**: Constrained algorithms support projections and pointer-to-member callables \[[[#^ConstrainedAlgorithms202023-1|1]]\]. This means you can use these algorithms with a wider variety of data types and structures, making your code more flexible and reusable.
3. **Informative Return Types**: The return types of most constrained algorithms have been changed to return all potentially useful information computed during the execution of the algorithm \[[[#^ConstrainedAlgorithms202023-1|1]]\]. This can make it easier to understand the result of an algorithm.

In contrast, non-constrained (traditional) algorithms in the STL do not have these features. They typically operate on a pair of iterators specifying a range, do not support projections or pointer-to-member callable, and often have return types that do not provide as much information about the result of the algorithm.
