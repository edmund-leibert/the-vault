Dynamic Partition Pruning (DPP) is a technique used in Apache Spark to optimize query performance when working with partitioned tables or data. It helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned during query execution by eliminating unnecessary partitions. This can significantly speed up query processing, especially for large datasets.

Here's an explanation of Spark Dynamic Partition Pruning with an example:

Suppose you have a large dataset of sales transactions stored in a partitioned table. The table is partitioned by the "year" and "month" columns, meaning that the data is divided into separate directories based on these two columns. Each directory contains sales data for a specific year and month.

Directory structure:
```
sales_data/
    year=2021/
        month=01/
            ...
        month=02/
            ...
        ...
    year=2022/
        month=01/
            ...
        month=02/
            ...
        ...
    ...
```

Now, let's say you want to query the total sales for the year 2022. Without Dynamic Partition Pruning, Spark would typically scan all partitions under the "year" column and then filter out the data for the year 2022 during the query execution. This can be very inefficient for large datasets.

Here's how Dynamic Partition Pruning works to optimize this query:

1. Query Planning:
   - When you write a SQL query or DataFrame operation to calculate the total sales for the year 2022, Spark's query planner will recognize that the query involves a filter condition on the "year" column (2022).
   - Spark's Catalyst optimizer will push this filter condition down into the query plan.

2. Pruning:
   - During the planning phase, Spark will analyze the table's metadata and identify which partitions contain data for the year 2022 (in this case, the "year=2022" partition).
   - Spark will then generate an optimized query plan that includes only the relevant partitions. In this example, it will skip scanning the data for all other years, significantly reducing the amount of data to be processed.

3. Execution:
   - When the query is executed, Spark will only read and process the data within the "year=2022" partition, ignoring all other partitions. This results in faster query performance as Spark prunes unnecessary data upfront.

The key benefit of Dynamic Partition Pruning is that it minimizes the amount of I/O and computation required for a query by intelligently selecting only the relevant partitions. This optimization becomes especially valuable when dealing with large datasets and complex queries.

By using Dynamic Partition Pruning, Spark can significantly improve query performance by avoiding the unnecessary scanning of data partitions, resulting in faster query execution times and more efficient resource utilization.
