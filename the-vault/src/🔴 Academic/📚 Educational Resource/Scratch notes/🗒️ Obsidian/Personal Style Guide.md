As of Feb. 10, 2024 03:09:42 PM, when typing, when should one **bold**, <ins>underline</ins>, surround by “double quotation marks”, surround by “single quotation marks”, or _italicize_? Employ the IEEE convention where possible.

When writing in accordance with the **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** convention, one can use specific formatting techniques to enhance clarity and emphasize different types of content [@caulfieldIEEEPaperFormat2022]. This is modified approach:

**Personal Style Guide (Derivative of the Text Formatting in IEEE Style)**:
- **Bold**: Use **bold** for major emphasis on important terms, headings, or key points. For instance, when introducing a significant concept or defining an acronym, consider using bold text
- _Italics_: Italics are commonly used for the following purposes:
	- _Titles of Works_: Italicize the titles of books, journals, articles, conference papers, and other published works. For example:
		- _IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks_
		- _Introduction to Quantum Computing_
	- _Variables and Symbols_: When referring to mathematical variables, use italics. For instance:
		- “Let _x_ represent the input vector.”
	- _Foreign Words or Phrases_: Italicize foreign words or phrases that are not commonly used in English. For example:
		- “The term _a priori_ refers to knowledge based on prior experience.”
	- *Minor emphasis*
- “Quotation Marks”:
	- Use double quotation marks (“ ”) for **direct quotations** from sources. For example:
		- According to Smith, “The algorithm converges after a finite number of iterations.”
	- Use single quotation marks (‘ ’) for **quotations within quotations**. For example:
		- The author states, “In his famous paper, ‘A New Approach to Optimization,’ Professor Lee proposed…”
- <ins>Underline</ins>: In IEEE style, underlining is **not recommended** for emphasis. Instead, use bold or italics. As such, underlining should be reserved only for links.
