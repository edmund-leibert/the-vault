## 🗒️ Node.js

﹇<br>
Is Node.js a framework or library? 

#card 

No. <span class="spoiler">Node.js®</span> is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

What does `npm fund` mean? 

#card-reverse 

- This command retrieves information on how to fund the dependencies of a given project.
	- If no package name is provided, it will list all dependencies that are looking for funding in a tree structure, listing the type of funding and the url to visit.
	- If a package name is provided then it tries to open its funding url using the `--browser` config param; if there are multiple funding sources for the package, the user will be instructed to pass the `--which` option to disambiguate.
- The list will avoid duplicated entries and will stack all packages that share the same url as a single entry. Thus, the list does not have the same shape of the output from `npm ls`.

What is the general process to creating a simple request/response “Hello, World!” application in Node.js? 

#card 

1. Start with creating the `main.js`
2. Import the http module
3. Create a server that can listen and do a response

What is the difference between `res.send()` and `res.end()`? 

#card-reverse 

 _ `res.send()` will check the structure of your output and set header information accordingly.
```javascript
app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
	res.send('<b>hello</b>');
});
```

});
```
[![enter image description here|350](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZXYm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZXYm.png)
- Where with `res.end()` you can only respond with text and it will not set "_Content-Type_"
```javascript
app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
	res.end('<b>hello</b>');
}); 
```
[![enter image description here|350](https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5gDv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5gDv.png)
- `res.send()` will set "ETag" attribute in the response header**_

app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
	res.send('<b>hello</b>');
});
```

<br>﹈<br>^1693875643492


﹇<br>
Why is this “ETag” tag important? 

#card 

The ETag HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource. It allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.

What is the difference between **node** and **node.js**?

#card 

- The terms “node” and “node.js” are often used interchangeably, but there can be a difference depending on the context.
- In the context of JavaScript runtime environment, there is no difference between “node” and “node.js”. [Both refer to the same thing: a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20057790/what-are-the-differences-between-node-js-and-node)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20057790/what-are-the-differences-between-node-js-and-node)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48513484/what-is-the-difference-between-node-and-nodejs).
- So, if you’re talking about JavaScript runtime environment, “node” and “node.js” are the same.

﹇<br>
In Node, can you run scripts in sequential *and* parallel order? 

#card 

- In plain Node.js, you can run multiple scripts sequentially by chaining them with `&&`.
	- For example: `node script1.js && node script2.js`.
- However, to run scripts in parallel, you would need to use a tool like `npm-run-all` or `concurrently`.

What is a child process? 

#card 

In computing, a child process is a process that is created by another process (the parent process). 

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643588


﹇<br>
How is a child process made? 

#card 

- This creation is done through a mechanism known as "forking," where the parent process makes a copy of itself.
- This copy, the child process, can then be changed to run a different program.
	- The parent process may continue executing concurrently with the child, or may wait for the child process to complete execution.

⌂

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643607


﹇<br>
In Node.js, what module provides the ability to spawn child processes? 

#card 

The `child_process` module.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643617


﹇<br>
In Node.js, can child processes communicate with their parents?

#card 

- The spawned child processes have three main communication channels with the parent: `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.
- These allow the parent and child processes to send and receive data from each other, if necessary. This module is often used to execute shell commands from within JavaScript code.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643626


Child processes can be either {synchronous (blocking)} or {asynchronous (non-blocking)}, depending on the method used to create them (`execSync`, `exec,` `spawn`, `fork`, etc.).
^1693875643634

﹇<br>
What is the main difference between `exec` and `execSync` in Node.js? 

#card

`exec` is asynchronous and doesn't block the Node.js event loop, allowing the application to continue doing other work while the command is executing. `execSync` is synchronous and blocks the Node.js event loop until the spawned shell command has completed.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643643


﹇<br>
**Front:** What happens when a command fails in `execSync`? 

#card

**Back:** When a command fails (returns a non-zero status) in `execSync`, it throws an error.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643652


﹇<br>
**Front:** In Node.js, how does `exec` handle the output from the shell command? 

#card

**Back:** `exec` provides the output to a callback function when the command has completed execution. The `stdout` and `stderr` from the command are passed to this callback function.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643660


﹇<br>
**Front:** What is the output of the `execSync` function in Node.js? 

#card

**Back:** `execSync` returns the stdout from the command as a Buffer object (or a string, if an encoding is specified).

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643671


﹇<br>
**Front:** What type of function (blocking or non-blocking) is `execSync` in Node.js? 

#card

**Back:** `execSync` is a blocking (synchronous) function.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643686


﹇<br>
**Front:** What type of function (blocking or non-blocking) is `exec` in Node.js? 

#card

**Back:** `exec` is a non-blocking (asynchronous) function.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643703


﹇<br>
What is a callback function in JavaScript? 

#card 

Also known as a “higher-order function”, a callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. Callback functions are often used in asynchronous operations, where the timing of the response cannot be predicted.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643713


﹇<br>
Explain the below code in the context of callback functions and Node.js’s `child_process` library. 

```js
import { exec } from 'child_process'; 
exec('ls -la', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
	if (error) {
		console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
		return;
	}
	console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`); 
	console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
});
```

#card 

- In this script, `ls -la` is a shell command that lists the files in the current directory in long format, including hidden files. This command is passed to `exec` along with a callback function. This function will be invoked when the `ls -la` command has completed.
- If there's an error executing the command, the error argument will contain an Error object describing what went wrong. If the command executed successfully, then stdout will contain the command's output, and stderr will contain any error messages the command produced. The callback function then logs these values to the console.

﹇<br>
What is the point of the braces in the statement?
```js
import { exec } from ‘child_process’`
```

#card 

- In JavaScript, the braces are used to import named exports from a module. If a module exports multiple items (like functions, objects, or values), you can import the ones you want using the curly braces `{}`.
- In the case of… 
```js
import { execSync } from 'child_process'; 
```
  `execSync` is a named export from the `child_process` module, so it needs to be imported with braces. If you want to import multiple named exports, you can list them all in the braces, separated by commas, like so:
```js
import { execSync, exec } from 'child_process';
```
- This would import both the `execSync` and `exec` functions from `child_process`.
- On the other hand, if a module has a default export, you can import it without braces:
```js
import fs from 'fs';
```
- In this example, `fs` is the default export from the `fs` module.
- In many cases, a module might have both default and named exports, and you can import them like this:
```js
import fs, { readFileSync } from 'fs';
```
- In this example, `fs` is the default export and `readFileSync` is a named export from the `fs` module.

What method does Node.js's `http` module use to write data to the response body? 

#card 

Node.js's `http` module uses the `res.write()` method to write data to the response body.

⌂

﹇<br>
What do you need to call to indicate you've finished sending the response in Node.js's `http` module? 

#card 

You need to call `res.end()` to indicate you've finished sending the response in Node.js's `http` module.

﹇<br>
What is the `res.send()` method in Express.js used for? 

#card 

The `res.send()` method in Express.js is used to send a response to the client and automatically closes the connection. It also sets the correct content-type and response length HTTP header based on the type of data being sent.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643774


﹇<br>
Can you send HTML files using the `res.write()` method in Node.js? 

#card 

Yes, you can send HTML files using the `res.write()` method in Node.js. You would typically use the `fs` (file system) module to read the HTML file, then write the contents to the response.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643782


﹇<br>
Does `res.write()` in Node.js's `http` module automatically set headers? 

#card 

No, `res.write()` in Node.js's `http` module does not automatically set headers. Headers can be set manually using `res.setHeader(name, value)` or `res.writeHead(statusCode[, statusMessage][, headers])`.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643788


﹇<br>
How does `res.send()` in Express.js differ from `res.write()` in Node.js in terms of header handling? 

#card 

`res.send()` in Express.js can automatically handle some header settings based on the type of data being sent. This automatic handling does not occur with `res.write()` in Node.js's `http` module.

Where should I put my script tags in an HTML file? 

#card 

- Usually The best place to put your `<script>` tags is usually at the bottom of the `<body>` section of your HTML file.
- This is because when a browser loads a website with a `<script>` tag, it has to stop parsing the HTML until the script has been downloaded and executed. This can cause a delay in rendering the page and result in a bad user experience. [By placing the `<script>` tags at the bottom of the `<body>` section, you ensure that the rest of the page content is loaded and displayed before the scripts are executed.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup)

What is **npx** in regards to Node.js? How is it different from **npm**?

#card 

- [`npx` is a package runner tool that comes with `npm`, the node package manager, starting from version 5.2.0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-differences-between-npm-and-npx/)[3](https://www.hacksparrow.com/nodejs/what-is-npx.html). [It’s designed to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry](about:blank#)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/).
- [The key difference between `npm` and `npx` lies in their execution of packages](about:blank#)[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50605219/difference-between-npx-and-npm)[5](https://techstacker.com/npx-vs-npm/)[6](https://history-computer.com/npx-vs-npm-whats-the-difference/)[7](https://history-computer.com/npm-vs-npx-differences-and-when-to-use-each/).
	- `npm` is primarily a package manager which you get out of the box when you install Node.js. [It allows developers to install packages both globally and locally](about:blank#)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/). [However, if you want to run a package using npm, you must specify that package in your `package.json` file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/). [When executables are installed via npm packages, npm creates links to them](about:blank#)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/).
	- On the other hand, `npx` is designed to make it easy to use package executables. [It can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-differences-between-npm-and-npx/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-differences-between-npm-and-npx/). [This means you can run code based on any version of a package which can be really helpful for testing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/).
- [In summary, while `npm` is used for installing libraries and managing their versions and dependencies, `npx` is used for executing one-off packages without installing them first](https://history-computer.com/npm-vs-npx-differences-and-when-to-use-each/)[7](https://history-computer.com/npm-vs-npx-differences-and-when-to-use-each/).

What is npm?

#card

`npm` (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime Node.js. It's used for installing, updating and managing package dependencies for your project.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643829


﹇<br>
What is npx?

#card

`npx` is a package runner tool that comes with `npm`. It's used for executing Node packages without installing them globally or locally. It can run packages directly from the `npm` registry or from local `node_modules` directory.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643835


﹇<br>
What happens when you install a package using npm?

#card

When you install a package using `npm`, it lists it under dependencies or devDependencies in your `package.json`, and also downloads the package code into the `node_modules/` directory. However, it doesn't automatically create a script to run that package.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643842


﹇<br>
How does `npx` run a command or script?

#card

`npx` first checks if the command exists in `$PATH` or in local project binaries. If not, it then installs the command/package temporarily from the npm registry and runs it.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643848


﹇<br>
How can you run a script defined in `package.json`?

#card

Scripts defined under the scripts section of `package.json `can be run using `npm run <script-name>`.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643855


﹇<br>
What is a major advantage of `npx` over `npm`?

#card

Unlike `npm`, `npx` allows you to run a command with a specific version of a package, or even execute code directly from a JavaScript file hosted on a URL or Git repository. This is especially useful for testing or running packages without permanently installing them.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693875643861


﹇<br>
If `npx` is present, then why do we need scripts in `package.json` file?

#card

Scripts in `package.json` file provide a standard and convenient way to manage, organize and run tasks, especially complex tasks or tasks run frequently. They act like custom commands for your project that can be executed by anyone aware of these scripts in your project
