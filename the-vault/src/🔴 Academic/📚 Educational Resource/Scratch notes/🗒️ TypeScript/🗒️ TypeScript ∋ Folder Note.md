The option {`--sourceMap`} tells the compiler that you want the source map generation. The next question is if you want them as separate files .js.map or not.

The option {`--inlineSourceMap`} will put generated source maps inside your .js file.

There is yet another option {`--inlineSources`}. This one will create a separate .js.map file, which will include the original TypeScript source so you don't need to deploy your .ts files under the server.

What is the benefit to using `--inlineSources` vs (`--inlineSourceMap` or `--sourceMap`)? #card 
- `--inlineSources` can be more convenient for development, but they increase the size of the JavaScript files delivered to the client, and they expose your source code to anyone who looks. 
- `--inlineSourceMap` or `--sourceMap` maps can be more complex to manage, but they allow you to keep your original source code hidden in production while still giving you the ability to debug problems effectively.

To clarify, when transpiling a typescript file to a JavaScript file using `tsc`, does it transpile everything to just one file? For instance, lets say I had a project with a `main.ts` that also imported logic from `A.ts` and `B.ts`. When I call `tsc`, do I only need to call it on `main.ts` and does it include the necessary logic also from `A.ts` and `B.ts`? #card 
- When you transpile a TypeScript file to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`), by default, each TypeScript file is transpiled to its corresponding JavaScript file. So, if you have `main.ts`, it will be transpiled to `main.js`, `A.ts` will be transpiled to `A.js`, and `B.ts` will be transpiled to `B.js`.
- However, the transpilation process does not automatically concatenate all the transpiled files into a single JavaScript file. Each TypeScript file will be transpiled to its own JavaScript file, maintaining the modular structure of your project.

What does `**` mean in `src/**/.ts`? #card 
- In the context of file patterns, the `**` is a glob pattern that matches any combination of characters across directory levels. It is often used as a wildcard for directory matching.
- In the example `"src/**/*.ts"`, the `**` matches any subdirectory within the `src` directory, and `*.ts` matches any TypeScript file with a `.ts` extension. So, the pattern `"src/**/*.ts"` matches all TypeScript files in any subdirectory of the `src` directory.
- Here's an example to illustrate how the `**` wildcard works:
	- `src/file.ts` matches the pattern.
	- `src/subdirectory/file.ts` matches the pattern.
	- `src/subdirectory/subsubdirectory/file.ts` matches the pattern.
- By using `**`, you can match files in any level of subdirectories within the specified directory.

What does export do in TypeScript? #card 
- Simply states that a class is importable across modules.
- For reference, look at the example code…
```typescript
// StringValidator.ts
export interface StringValidator {
    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;
}
// ZipCodeValidator.ts
import { StringValidator } from "./StringValidator";
export const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;
export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {
    isAcceptable(s: string) {
        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `StringValidator` interface is exported from the `StringValidator.ts` file using the `export` keyword. It is then imported into the `ZipCodeValidator.ts` file using the `import` statement. The `ZipCodeValidator` class and the `numberRegexp` constant are also exported from the `ZipCodeValidator.ts` file using the `export` keyword.

In the context of developing plugins for Obsidian, when I build my plugin in debug mode with the `--inlineSources`, does Dev Tools recognize the path to the original TypeScript? #card 

In the context of TypeScript, what is the relation of the **tsc** option `inlineSources`, `sourceMap`, and `inlineSourceMap`. #card
1. First, you got two options in how you want your `.map` file generated. Either you can have the contents of it inside your generated `main.js` file (i.e., `inlineSources`) or you can have it separate (i.e., `sourceMap`)
	- There is further option of using (`inlineSources`) so that the content of your `main.ts` is embedded in your “map.”
		- Downside of this is that your `main.ts` code is exposde.
