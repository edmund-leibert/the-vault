What is an **enum** in Python?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

An **enum** is a special type of data structure in Python that allows you to define a set of named constants.

Why use enums in Python?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

Enums can make your Python code more readable, maintainable, and error-resistant.

﹇<br>
How do you define an enum in Python 3.10 or later?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

You use the `enum` module and subclass the `Enum` class to create your own enums.

For example…
```python
from enum import Enum
```

﹇<br>
How do you access members of an enum?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

You use the dot notation to access members of an enum.

﹇<br>
In Python, how do you iterate over the members of an enum?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

You use a for loop to iterate over the members of an enum.

﹇<br>
How can you use enums in switch statements?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python 

You can use enums in switch statements to match different cases.

```python
from enum import Enum

class Color(Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3
```

```python
def get_color_name(color):
    match color:
        case Color.RED:

What does the `+`, `-`, `#`, and `~` symbols before an attribute and operation in name in a class

#card 

The `+`, `-`, `#` and `~` symbols before an attribute and operation name in a class denote the visibility of the attribute and operation.

- `+` denotes public attributes or operations
- `-` denotes private attributes or operations
- `#` denotes protected attributes or operations
- `~` denotes package attributes or operations

What does “feeding a new table mean in the context of data engineering”?

#card 

In the context of data engineering, “feeding a new table” typically refers to the process of populating a newly created database table with data. This can be done through various methods such as:

- **Data ingestion**: This is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. [The data could be streaming in real time or ingested in batches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering).
- [**Data transformation**: This involves converting the data from the format it is ingested in into a format that can be used for further processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[2](https://mindtitan.com/resources/blog/what-is-data-engineering/).
- [**Data loading**: This is the process of writing the data into the target database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[2](https://mindtitan.com/resources/blog/what-is-data-engineering/).

[The data used to feed the new table can come from various sources such as existing databases, data warehouses, external data sources, or real-time data streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[2](https://mindtitan.com/resources/blog/what-is-data-engineering/). [The specific method and tools used to feed a new table can vary depending on the specific requirements of the data engineering task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)[2](https://mindtitan.com/resources/blog/what-is-data-engineering/).
