## 1. Introduction

 What was the motivation is for pivoting their infrastructure to Redshift?
  #card 
- The author pivoted to AWS Redshift for several reasons. Initially, the author‚Äôs company used a dashboarding and reporting solution that directly queried the live transactional database. This approach worked well when there were only a few users, but as the number of paying customers increased, the dashboards and reports became slow and even timed out. The company tried to fix this by disabling non-critical features, rewriting problematic queries, fine-tuning indexes, and adding caching. However, these changes only brought temporary relief and did not solve the problem completely.
- The company then introduced an intermediary layer that ran nightly roll-ups to query an already aggregated, highly compressed data set. This solution worked for a while, but still had problems. The scheduled nightly roll-ups impacted a small set of customers, and having to tune schemas and indexes for both transactional and dashboarding workloads made things more complex and fragile.
- The company decided to port the existing functionality onto infrastructure that could better handle their ever-increasing needs. They quickly settled on Amazon Redshift because of its low operational requirements, low cost, scalability, and support for Standard SQL. The company was able to build a proof of concept in just a couple of weeks and got decent results early on. They were even able to drop the intermediary roll-up layer, saving thousands of lines of code and removing another operational concern.

What is a quick summary of AWS Redshift?
#card 
Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to analyze structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes using SQL. Redshift is designed to deliver fast performance for even the most demanding and unpredictable workloads, with resources automatically provisioned and data warehouse capacity intelligently scaled.

What is an example of Redshift loading data from AWS S3? 
#card 
- Yes, **Redshift** can load data from **S3** using the `COPY` command. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to load data from Amazon S3 into Redshift¬≤:
	1. **Download data files**: Download data files that use comma-separated value (CSV), character-delimited, and fixed-width formats.
	2. **Create an Amazon S3 bucket**: Create an Amazon S3 bucket and then upload the data files to the bucket.
	3. **Launch an Amazon Redshift cluster**: Launch an Amazon Redshift cluster and create database tables.
	4. **Use COPY commands**: Use COPY commands to load the tables from the data files on Amazon S3.
	5. **Troubleshoot load errors**: Troubleshoot load errors and modify your COPY commands to correct the errors.
- The `COPY` command leverages the Amazon Redshift massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture to read and load data in parallel from a file or multiple files in an Amazon S3 bucket¬≥. You can take maximum advantage of parallel processing by splitting your data into multiple files, in cases where the files are compressed¬≥. Data is loaded into the target table, one line per row, and the fields in the data file are matched to table columns in order, left to right¬≥.

What is the difference between a data warehouse and a data lake? 
#card 
- **Data warehouse**
	- [A data warehouse and a data lake are both widely used to store data for analytics, but they have some key differences](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)[1](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/).
	- [A data warehouse is a repository for structured, filtered data that has already been processed for a specific purpose](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)[1](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/).
	- [The schema is defined before the data is stored, and it is designed to be queried and analyzed for specific purposes](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)[1](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/).
- **Data Lake**
	- [On the other hand, a data lake is a vast pool of raw data, the purpose for which is not yet defined](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)[1](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/).
	- [It can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple sources in its original format](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)[1](https://www.talend.com/resources/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/).
	- [The schema is defined after the data is stored, which offers agility and easy data capture](https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse)[2](https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse).
- In summary, the main differences between a data warehouse and a data lake are:
	- A data warehouse stores structured, filtered data that has already been processed for a specific purpose, while a data lake stores raw data from multiple sources in its original format.
	- A data warehouse defines the schema before the data is stored, while a data lake defines the schema after the data is stored.
	- A data warehouse is designed to be queried and analyzed for specific purposes, while a data lake offers agility and easy data capture.
