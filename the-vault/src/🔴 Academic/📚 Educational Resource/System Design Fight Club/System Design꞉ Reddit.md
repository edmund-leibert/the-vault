REDDIT

RESOURCES:
- just for numbers to use: https://foundationinc.co/lab/reddit-statistics/
- the Exponent video was actually not that great

REQUIREMENTS:
1. users can make posts
2. upvotes downvotes on the posts of others users
3. a) view/ read "TOP" posts list
   b) view/ read "NEW" posts list
   c) view/ read "HOT" posts list

OUT OF SCOPE:
- comments on posts
- text search functionality
- user karma calculation

Call outs:
- thread contention for upvotes is actually very low; CRDTs not necessary
- we could definitely have a "celebrity problem" or "hot partition" issue in regards to popular subreddits
	- choosing an alternative partition key comes at the trade-off of deep pagination performance due to "scatter-gather"
- Why does "celebrity partition"/"hot partition" not apply to individual posts? hot partitions are more applicable "range" of keys, plus volume on individual posts never gets that high 
- fan out like twitter? likely not a good idea because the posts jump around (re-order) too much, rather than twitter which should maintain a chronological order

NUMBERS :
- 50M DAU
- 330 MAU
- 21B "screen views" per month
    -> 7,000 TPS (read, req #3)
- 1.6B "visits" in one month
    -> 533 TPS (reads, req #3)
- 168B "page views" in 2018 (one full year duration)
    -> 4,600 TPS (reads, req #3)
- 32B upvotes in 2019 (one full year duration)
    -> 877 TPS (writes, req #2)
- 199M posts created in 2019 (one full year duration)
    -> 5.45 TPS (writes, req #1)
- 2.8M total subreddits
---
7,000 TPS (reads, req #3)
877 TPS (writes, req #2)
5.45 TPS (writes, req #1)

So, this is going to be read heavy

- top post stats
    - 439k upvotes on top post for all-time
    - 310k upvotes on top post for past year
    - 150k upvotes on top post for past month
    - 149k upvotes on top post for past week
    - 90.5k upvotes on top post for today

So, upvotes come in at an exponential decay
And, even the most viral of posts for the entire site- seem to max ‚Ä¢out at around 1-2 TPS for upvote rate
Thus, there's actually tow thread contention for upvotes on posts

Derived secondary numbers:
- 8.6 "page views" per ‚Ä¢ "visit"
    - since at least one of those page views is likely to be of the homepage,
    -> 500 - 850 TPS for the homepage

If I desire to learn more about designing a *search functionality* like Reddit, where should I look?

#card 

```timestamp

Can just probably look at like Twitter, or you can look at something that does like an inverted index.
- Much more suitable problem for exploring search functionality, specifically text search functionality

In the context of how this video is structured, what are call outs?

How is TPS calculated? 

#card 

The TPS is calculated by taking the total number of transactions performed over a given time period and dividing it by the number of seconds in that time period.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
How can you calculate and find the TPS from 21 Billion transactions in a month.

#card

1. Calculate the total number of seconds in a month:<br>
   $30$ days $\cdot$ $24$ hours/day $\cdot$ $60$ minutes/hour $\cdot$ $60$ seconds/minute $=$ $2,592,000$ seconds
2. Thus, we find that‚Ä¶
   $$
   \text{TPS} = \frac{21,000,000,000 \: \text{transactions}}{ 2,592,000 \: \text{seconds}} = 7,000 \: \text{TP}
   $$

#card 

Yes ‚ùó

Ôπá<br>
What is the *celebrity problem* and how does it appear in this Reddit design problem?

#card 

‚ùó There is a large number of subreddits with only a few trafficking in all the activity.
