The spark executor without considering the underlying hardware capabilities and workload characteristics can be a bad idea for several reasons:

1. Resource contention: Spark executors compete for CPU and memory resources on a worker node. If you assign too many cores to an executor, it can lead to resource contention, where multiple tasks within the same executor fight for CPU time and memory, causing inefficient utilization and potentially slowing down processing. This can lead to poor overall cluster performance.

2. Oversubscription: Assigning a high number of cores to an executor can lead to oversubscription of CPU resources on the worker node. Oversubscription occurs when you allocate more cores than the physical CPU cores available on the node. This can result in excessive context switching and degraded performance due to CPU contention.

3. Inefficient parallelism: Spark already manages parallelism by dividing tasks into smaller stages and distributing them across executors. Assigning too many cores to an executor can result in excessive parallelism within that executor, which may not lead to improved performance and can even degrade it. Efficient parallelism depends on various factors like data distribution and task granularity.

4. Memory management: Memory allocation is also a critical consideration. Each executor needs enough memory to process its tasks efficiently. If you allocate a large number of cores to an executor without sufficient memory, it can lead to frequent out-of-memory errors or inefficient swapping to disk.

5. Hardware limitations: The physical hardware of the worker nodes can limit the number of cores that can be effectively utilized. Oversubscribing CPU cores can lead to diminished performance as the hardware may not be capable of handling the assigned load.

6. Task scheduling: Spark's scheduler allocates tasks to executors based on available resources. Assigning an excessive number of cores to an executor may disrupt the scheduler's ability to efficiently allocate tasks across the cluster.

To determine the optimal number of cores to assign to Spark executors, you should consider the following factors:

- Hardware specifications of worker nodes (CPU cores, memory)
- Nature of the Spark application (CPU-bound vs. memory-bound)
- Task granularity and data distribution
- Cluster workload and concurrent job requirements

It's important to strike a balance between concurrency and resource utilization. Monitoring the cluster's performance and adjusting the configuration based on observed behavior is essential to achieving optimal Spark performance. Benchmarking and experimenting with different configurations can help find the best settings for your specific workload and hardware environment.
