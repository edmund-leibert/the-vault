## Update the source code

ï¹‡<br>
After updating your source code, what must you always check what you _might_ need to do?

#card 

Need to check if you need to build an updated version of your image using the `docker build` command.

âŒ‚
<br>ï¹ˆ<br>

ï¹‡<br>
What does this error mean/entail?

```
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint laughing_burnell 
(bb242b2ca4d67eba76e79474fb36bb5125708ebdabd7f45c8eaf16caaabde9dd): Bind for 127.0.0.1:3000 failed: port is already allocated.
```

#card 

The error occurred because you aren't able to start the new container while your old container is still running. The reason is that the old container is already using the host's port 3000 and only one process on the machine (containers included) can listen to a specific port. 

To fix this, you need to remove the old container.

<br>ï¹ˆ<br>

## Remove the old container

### Remove a container using the CLI

ï¹‡<br>
Via the CLI, what are the general steps to removing the ID of a container?

#card 

1. Get the ID of the container by using theÂ `docker ps`Â command.
    ```bash
    $ docker ps
    ```
2. Use theÂ `docker stop`Â command to stop the container. ReplaceÂ `<the-container-id>`Â with the ID fromÂ `docker ps`.
    ```bash
    $ docker stop <the-container-id>
    ```
3. Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using theÂ `docker rm`Â command.    
    ```bash
    $ docker rm <the-container-id>
    ```

ï¹‡<br>
What must I always remember to do after stopping a container if I wish I rebuild the image that it is based on?

#card 

I **must** remember to stop it _and_ remove it completely.

âŒ‚
<br>ï¹ˆ<br>

ï¹‡<br>
How can you stop and remove a container in a single command?

#card 

> [!Note] 
> You can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding theÂ `force`Â flag to theÂ `docker rm`Â command. For example:Â `docker rm -f <the-container-id>`
