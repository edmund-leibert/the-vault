In this walkthrough, you'll learn the <span class="cloze cloze-curly-brackets">{1:basic steps of building an image and running your own container}</span>. This walkthrough uses a sample Node.js application, but it's not necessary to know Node.js.

## [Step 1: Get the sample application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/run-a-container/#step-1-get-the-sample-application)

## [Step 2: View the Dockerfile in your project folder](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/run-a-container/#step-2-view-the-dockerfile-in-your-project-folder)

To {1:run your code in a container}, the most fundamental thing you need is a {2:Dockerfile}.

A {1:Dockerfile} {2:describes what goes into a container}.

## [Step 3: Build your first image](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/run-a-container/#step-3-build-your-first-image)

You always need an {1:image} to run a {2:container}.

> [!TIP]
> To run Docker commands, you must use a terminal. Based on your operating system, you can open a terminal by doing the following:
> 
> For Windows, select the Start Menu, specifyÂ `cmd`, and then selectÂ **Command Prompt**.
> 
> For Mac, select theÂ **Launchpad**Â icon in the Dock, specifyÂ `Terminal`Â in the search field, then selectÂ **Terminal**.

After your image is built, you can view your image in theÂ {2:**Images**Â tab in Docker Desktop}.

## [Step 4: Run your container](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/run-a-container/#step-4-run-your-container)

## [Step 5: View the frontend](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/run-a-container/#step-5-view-the-frontend)
