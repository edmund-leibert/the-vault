What does Docker do with all content, code, and data in a container?

#card 

Docker isolates all content, code, and data in a container from your local filesystem.

What happens when you delete a Docker container?

#card 

Docker deletes all the content within that container.

What can you use if you want to persist the data that a container generates?

#card 

You can use volumes.

## [Step 1: Get the sample application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/#step-1-get-the-sample-application)


## [Step 2: Add a volume to persist data](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/#step-2-add-a-volume-to-persist-data)

ï¹‡<br>
What is a volume in Docker?

#card 

A volume is a location in your local filesystem, automatically managed by Docker Desktop. It is used to persist data after you delete a container.

ï¹‡<br>
How do you add a volume to a project?

#card 

To add a volume to a project, open the compose.yaml file in a code or text editor, and uncomment the lines under theÂ `volumes`Â element of the service (e.g.,Â `todo-database`).

<br>ï¹ˆ<br>^1700429007413

ï¹‡<br>
What does theÂ `volumes`Â element nested under a service (e.g.,Â `todo-database`) do in a Compose file?

#card 

TheÂ `volumes`Â element that is nested under a service tells Compose to mount the volume (e.g.,Â `database`) to a specific path (e.g.,Â `/data/db`) in the container for the service.

âŒ‚
<br>ï¹ˆ<br>^1700429007421

ï¹‡<br>
What does the top-levelÂ `volumes`Â element do in a Compose file?

#card 

The top-levelÂ `volumes`Â element defines and configures a volume that can be used by any of the services in the Compose file.

ï¹‡<br>
How exactly are volumes managed by Docker?

#card 

[Volumes in Docker are completely managed by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) [@Volumes0000].Â [They are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) [@ManageDataDocker0000].Â [This management by Docker provides several advantages such as ease of backup, migration, and sharing among multiple containers](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) [@Volumes0000] [@ManageDataDocker0000].Â 

[So, while the data in the volume persists even after the container is deleted, the management of these volumes is handled automatically by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) [@Volumes0000] [@ManageDataDocker0000].

Break line by line, paying specific attention in regard to the volume parts, what is happening in this snippet of a `compose.yaml` fileâ€¦

```yaml
  todo-database:
    image: mongo:6
    volumes:
      - database:/data/db
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

volumes:
  database:
```

#card 

- `todo-database:`: This is the name of the service. In this case, itâ€™s a MongoDB database service.
- `image: mongo:6`: This line tells Docker to use the `mongo:6` image from Docker Hub for this service.
- `volumes:`: This is where you define any volumes that you want to attach to this service.
- `- database:/data/db`: This line is doing two things:
    - `database`: This is the name of the volume as defined in the Docker Compose file. Docker will automatically create this volume if it doesnâ€™t exist.
    - `/data/db`: This is the path inside the container where the volume will be mounted. Any data that the MongoDB service writes to `/data/db` will be stored in the `database` volume on the host machine.
- `ports:`: This is where you define any ports that you want to expose from this service.
- `- 27017:27017`: This line is mapping port 27017 of the container to port 27017 of the host machine.
- `volumes:`: This is a top-level element in the Docker Compose file where you can define and configure volumes.
- `database:`: This is defining a volume named `database`. This volume can be used by any service in the Docker Compose file. In this case, itâ€™s being used by the `todo-database` service.

So, in summary, this configuration is setting up a MongoDB service with a volume named `database`. The volume is mounted to `/data/db` inside the container. This means any data written to `/data/db` inside the MongoDB container will be stored in the `database` volume on the host machine, persisting data across container restarts or removals. The MongoDB service is accessible via port 27017 on the host machine.

## [Step 3: Run the application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/#step-3-run-the-application)

## [Step 4: View the frontend and add todos](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/#step-4-view-the-frontend-and-add-todos)

## [Step 5: Delete the application stack and run new containers](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/#step-5-delete-the-application-stack-and-run-new-containers)

ï¹‡<br>
What happens to your data when you delete and recreate containers in Docker Desktop?

#card 

If the image is configured to persist data, for example on a volume, Docker Desktop persists your data and itâ€™s accessible to any container on your system by mounting the database volume. 

Docker Desktop looks for the database volume and creates it if it doesnâ€™t exist.

How do you delete an application stack in Docker Desktop?

#card 

To delete an application stack, open the Containers tab of Docker Desktop and select the Delete icon next to your application stack.
