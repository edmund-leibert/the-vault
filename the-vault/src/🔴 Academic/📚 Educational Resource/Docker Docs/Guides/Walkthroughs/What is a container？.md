A {{1:container} is an {2:isolated environment for your code}.

Ôπá<br>
Does a container have knowledge of your operating system, or files?

#card 

No, a container has no knowledge of your operating system, or your files

Ôπá<br>
Do _containers_ have everything that you need in order to run, down to a base operating system?

#card 

Yes.

## Step 1: Set up walkthrough

Ôπá<br>
What exactly is the **Host port** option under **Optional settings** when running a image from Docker Desktop?

![|400](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/images/getting-started-setup.webp?w=250&border=true)

#card 

The **Host port** option under **Optional settings** when running an image from Docker Desktop is used to map a port on your host machine to a port in the Docker container. This is known as port mapping or port forwarding.

When you run a Docker container, it has its own set of port numbers. [If you want to access a service on this container from your host machine or network, you need to map a port on your host to a port on the container](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/). [@ExploreNetworkingFeatures0200] [@baeldungAssigningPortMapping2022] 

The syntax for this in Docker is `-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`. [Here, `HOST_PORT` is the port number on your host machine, and `CONTAINER_PORT` is the port number in the container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62125794/docker-run-p-what-are-this-two-port-numbers-and-what-they-represents). [@salkiAnswerDockerRun2020] [@baeldungAssigningPortMapping2022] 

For example, if you have a web server running in a Docker container listening on port 80, and you want to access it from your host machine on port 8000, you would use `-p 8000:80`. [Now, if you open a web browser on your host machine and go to `localhost:8000`, you‚Äôll be able to access the web server running in your Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/).

## Step 2: View containers on Docker Desktop

Ôπá<br>
Can you view your containers in Docker Desktop?

#card 

Yes, you can view it in the¬†**Containers**¬†tab of Docker Desktop.

Ôπá<br>
The container in this walkthrough runs a simple web server that displays a simple website. What is an example architecture of a more complex project using docker containers?

#card 

When working with more complex projects, you'll run different parts in different containers. For example, a different container for the frontend, backend, and database. In this walkthrough, you only have a simple frontend container.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1700215950567

## Step 3: View the frontend

## Step 4: Explore your container

Ôπá<br>
In Docker Desktop, how can you easily view and interact with different aspects of your container?

#card 

In Docker Desktop, simply select your container and then select¬†**Files**¬†to explore your container's isolated file system.

<br>Ôπà<br>^1700215950573

Ôπá<br>
In Docker Desktop, when I inspect the files of a running container, what does the note ‚Äúmodified‚Äù mean of a file?

![|550](the-vault/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020231117020633.png)

#card 

[In Docker Desktop, when you inspect the files of a running or stopped container, you can see which files have been recently added, modified, or deleted](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/container/)[1](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/container/). [The ‚Äúmodified‚Äù note indicates that the file has been changed or updated in some way since the container was started](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/container/)[1](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/container/). 

[This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as an application within the container writing to the file, a user manually editing the file, or a system process updating the file](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-inspect-changes-to-a-docker-containers-filesystem/)[2](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-inspect-changes-to-a-docker-containers-filesystem/). 

[Remember, any changes made to the container‚Äôs filesystem will be lost when the container is restarted or destroyed, unless those changes are made in a volume](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-inspect-changes-to-a-docker-containers-filesystem/)[2](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-inspect-changes-to-a-docker-containers-filesystem/).

## Step 5: Stop your container

The¬†`welcome-to-docker`¬†container continues to {1:run} until you {2:stop it}. To {2:stop} the container in Docker Desktop, go to the¬†{3:**Containers**}¬†tab and select the¬†{4:**Stop**}¬†icon in the¬†{5:**Actions**}¬†column of your container.
