## Tutorial

### When to use Typst

### What you will learn

### Writing in Typst

How do you mark a text as a heading in Typst? #card-reverse 
To add a heading, enter the `=` character
```
= Introduction
```

How do you emphasize some text with italics? #card-reverse 
To emphasize some text with italics, enclose it in <b><i>\_underscores\_</i></b>

What determines the nesting level of a heading? #card-reverse 
The number ofÂ `=`Â characters determines the nesting level of the heading.

How to create a numbered list in Typst? #card-reverse 
- For each item of the list, we type aÂ `+`Â character at the beginning of the line.

How to create a bulleted list in Typst? #card-reverse 
If we wanted to add a bulleted list, we would use theÂ `-`Â character instead of theÂ `+`Â character.

What does Typst reserve markup symbols for? Why so? #card 
- `=`,Â `-`,Â `+`, andÂ `_`Â to create headings, lists and emphasized text, respectively. 
	- However, having a special symbol for everything we want to insert into our document would soon become cryptic and unwieldy.
	- For this reason, Typst reserves markup symbols only for the most common things. Everything else is inserted withÂ _functions._

How to insert an image in Typst? #card 
Use Typst'sÂ [`image`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/)Â function

How to call a function in markup? #card 
First need to type the `#` character, immediately followed by the name of the function.

How to change the `width` of an image? #card 
- Pass the `width` argument to the `image` function.
- For example:
	```js
	#image("glacier.jpg", width: 70%)
	``` 

What is a *named* argument? #card 
- An argument to a function that must be specified.
- For exampleâ€¦ `name: value` would be passed to the function instead of just `value`
