How to rename a branch?

#card-reverse 

Sure, here's how you can rename a branch in Git:

1. If you want to rename the current branch, you can use the following command:
```bash
git branch -m new-name
```

2. If you want to rename a different branch, you can use the following command:
```bash
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

3. If you have already pushed the old branch to the remote repository, you need to delete it and push the new branch. Here's how:
```bash
git push origin --delete old-name
git push origin -u new-name
```

﹇<br>
What is important to remember when renaming branches locally? 

#card-reverse 

Note that renaming a branch only affects your local repository.

If you have already pushed the branch to a remote repository, you will need to update the remote repository as well. You can do this by deleting the old branch from the remote repository and pushing the new branch:
```bash
# Delete the old branch from the remote repository
git push origin --delete old-name
# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push origin new-name
```

How do you rename an existing remote? 

#card-reverse 

`git remote rename [old name] [new name]`

﹇<br>
Does renaming an existing remote, also rename the repository name on the hosting provider? (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)? 

#card 

No, the `git remote rename` command only renames the remote in your local repository. It does not change the name of the repository on GitHub or any other remote hosting service. 

If you want to rename your repository on GitHub, you can do so through the repository settings on the GitHub website.

In `.gitignore`, how do you match any level of subdirectories? 

#card 

- Use the wildcard `**`
- For example…
```git

How to configure git to always **push the current branch and set the remote as upstream** automatically every time you push? 

#card-reverse 

Run the following command…

`git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true`

The <span class="spoiler">`--global`</span> flag means this will apply to all git commands on your machine (regardless of which repo it is), you can omit the flag to make it specific to a single repo on your machine.

How do you delete a remote branch in Git? 

#card 

[You can use the `git push` command with the `-d` flag followed by the name of the remote branch you want to delete](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-delete-branch-how-to-remove-a-local-or-remote-branch/)

For example:

```bash
git push origin -d remote_branch_name
```

How to set up my git name and git email? 

#card 

You can set up your Git username and email address by using the `git config` command. To set your global commit name and email address, run the `git config` command with the `--global` option:

```bash session
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

[Once done, you can confirm that the information is set by running: `git config --list`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-git-username-and-email/) [1](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-git-username-and-email/).

In regards to `.gitignore`, how to fix Visual Studio Code still tracking changes of files that should be ignored? 

#card 

There could be a few reasons why VS Code is still recognizing files that are in your `.gitignore` file.

One possibility is that the files were added to your cache.
- [You can try clearing it with the command `git rm --cached .vscode/settings.json`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57187693/how-to-fix-vscode-tracking-in-gitignore)

What is the **GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow**? 

#card 

1. Create a fork, _usually_ you should only include the “default” (e.g. `master` or `main`) branch from the upstream (i.e., the repository we are forking from).
2. Create a branch off the original “default” and call it .
3. Then submit a pull request when done.

How do you ignore all folders with the name containing the word “build”? 

#card-reverse 

Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:
```
**/*build*/
```
- This will ignore any folder with the word “build” in its name, regardless of its location in the repository.

What is the opposite of git add? 

#card-reverse 

The opposite of `git add` is `git reset`. The `git add` command stages changes to be committed, while the `git reset` command unstages changes. Here’s an example:

```bash
# Stage changes to file.txt
git add file.txt
# Unstage changes to file.txt
git reset file.txt
```

This will unstage the changes to `file.txt` that were previously staged using `git add`. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

What is the difference between `fetch` and `pull`? 

#card-reverse  

<span class="spoiler">`Fetch`</span> and <span class="spoiler">`pull`</span> are both used to download new data from a remote repository. <span class="spoiler">`Fetch`</span> only downloads new data from a remote repository but it doesn’t integrate any of this new data into your working files. <span class="spoiler">`Pull`</span>, on the other hand, not only downloads new data but also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1700962345875

﹇<br>
Front: What does it mean to integrate new data into your working files? 

#card-reverse 

Back: By “integrate,” it means that <span class="spoiler">`pull`</span> not only downloads new data from the remote repository but also merges it with your local branch. This means that any changes made in the remote repository are applied to your local repository, updating your current working copy files with the latest changes from the remote repository.

So I just cloned a repo, and I having a weird issue. Right now, I am working on brnach `A`, However, I have a branch on my origin called `B`. For some reason, when I call `git fetch`, and then run `git branch -l`, the branch `B` is not being shown as a branch in the list. Only the branch `A` is being shown. What gives? 

#card 

- The `git branch` command, without any parameters, only shows your local branches. [When you fetch, information about your remote branches is updated, but it will only be shown when you use `git branch -r` (only remote branches) or `git branch -a` (all remote and local branches)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to see the remote branch `B` after fetching it, you can use the command `git branch -a`. [This will show you a list of all local and remote branches, including the remote branch `B`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to checkout the remote branch `B`, you can use the command `git checkout B`. This will create a new local branch called `B` that tracks the remote branch `B`. After checking out the remote branch, you should be able to see it when running the `git branch` command[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).

What does `git submodule add` do? 

#card 

1. **Clones the Submodule:** Starts by cloning the repository provided via a URL into the path specified in your current repository
2. **Stages the Changes:** Stages the new submodule.
3. **Commits the Changes:** The changes can be committed as usual with `git commit`.

When other clone or pull your repository, they need to use the `--recursive` flag to ensure that the submodules are properly initialized…

```bash
git clone --recursive [URL-to-your-repository]
```

Submodules are not automatically updated, nor do they track the origin. As such, if the remote repository is updated, you won’t automatically get those changes in your repository; you need to to manually update the submodule to point to a newer commit.

How do you change the `git init` default branch name?

#card 

As of Git 2.28 (released 27th July 2020), you [can now configure the name of the branch created when you init a new repository](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-highlights-from-git-2-28/#introducing-init-defaultbranch):

```powershell
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

After setting this variable, running `git init` will produce a repository whose initial branch is `main`:

```powershell
$ git init
Initialised empty Git repository in /home/thomas/test-git-repo/.git/
$ git status
On branch main
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

<br>﹈<br>^1700962345949

﹇<br>
What does `git fetch origin` do?

#card 

`git fetch` is the command that tells Git to fetch changes from a remote repository.

`origin` in `git fetch origin` specifies which remote repository to fetch from. When you clone a repository, Git automatically names the repository you've cloned from as "origin", though you can have multiple remotes with different names.
 
 Now, what does `git fetch` actually do?
   1. **Downloads Objects and Refs**: It contacts the specified remote (in this case, "origin"), and downloads any new changes (objects like commits, trees, blobs) and references (like branches and tags) that you don't have in your local repository.
   2. **Updates Remote-tracking Branches**: When you fetch from a remote, Git will also update what are called "remote-tracking branches". These are references to the state of branches on the remote repositories. They take the format `<remote>/<branch>`. For instance, after running `git fetch origin`, if the origin has a branch named `master`, your local repo will have an updated reference named `origin/master` that tracks the state of the `master` branch on `origin`.
   3. **Does NOT Merge or Modify Working Directory**: Unlike `git pull`, which is essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge` (or `git rebase`), `git fetch` on its own does not modify your current working branch or your working directory. It merely fetches the new data and updates the remote-tracking branches.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1700962345953

﹇<br>
Why is `git fetch origin` so useful?

#card

It allows you to see changes from the remote repository without integrating them into your local branch immediately. This provides you an opportunity to review changes, decide on a merge or rebase strategy, or even just be aware of what's happening in other parts of the project.

It is a safe operation in that it won't affect your local branches or working directory. So, you can run `git fetch` at any time to get updated information from the remote without worrying about disturbing your current work. 

In the context of the problem you were facing, `git fetch origin` ensures you have the latest state of the `master` branch from `origin` before you perform the reset operation.
⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1700962345959

﹇<br>
Lets consider the case that you have a repo in which you are having merge conflict like so…

Why do we need to cautious about `git reset --hard`?

#card 

Be cautious with `git reset --hard` as it will discard changes in your working directory and index.

If you've made local commits that you want to keep, you'll need to take a different approach (like creating a new branch for those commits or rebasing).

﹇<br>
So, even though my local repository is based on my `origin` (hosted on GitHub) being a fork (i.e., the `upstream`) of my original repository, when I run the command `git branch -la`, the output is not listing any `upstream` branches. How can I fix this?

#card 

If you are not seeing an `upstream` remote when you run `git branch -la`, it means that an `upstream` remote has not been added to your local clone. The `upstream` remote typically refers to the original repository that your fork was created from, and it allows you to keep your fork up to date with changes made in the original repository.

You can add an `upstream` remote to your local clone by running the following command:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
```

Make sure to replace `original-owner` and `original-repo` with the username of the owner of the original repository and the name of the original repository, respectively.

After adding the `upstream` remote, you can fetch changes from the original repository by running `git fetch upstream`. You can then merge these changes into your local branch by running `git merge upstream/branch-name`, where `branch-name` is the name of the branch that you want to merge changes from.

Is `git fetch` the same as `git fetch --all`?

#card 

[The command `git fetch` fetches data only from the default remote, which is usually `origin`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all). On the other hand, `git fetch --all` fetches data from all remotes[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all). So if you have multiple remotes configured for your repository, `git fetch --all` will fetch from all of them[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all).

[Additionally, if you want to remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote before fetching, you can use the `-p` or `--prune` flag with the `git fetch` command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference). [For example, `git fetch --all -p` would fetch from all remotes and prune any references that no longer exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference).

After I run the command `git submodule init`, the directory that should be containing the submodule is empty. Why is this the case and how can I fix this?

#card 

After running `git submodule init`, the submodule directory may still appear empty. This is because `git submodule init` only initializes the local configuration file for the submodule, but it does not actually fetch the data from the submodule repository.

[To fetch the data from the submodule repository and populate the submodule directory, you need to run `git submodule update --init`](about:blank#)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11358082/empty-git-submodule-folder-when-repo-cloned).

Using Git, how can I fetch all the branches from my remote repository named origin?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/technology/git 

You can fetch all the branches from your remote repository named `origin` by using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This command will fetch all the branches from the remote repository named `origin`. After fetching, you can check out to any branch using `git checkout <branch-name>`. If the branch does not exist in your local repository, it will be created. Please replace `<branch-name>` with the actual name of the branch.

Remember, `git fetch` only downloads the data from the remote repository but does not merge changes into your current branch. If you want to merge the changes, you can use `git pull` instead.

How can you rename a remote branch in Git?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/technology/git 

To rename a remote branch in Git, you can follow these steps:

1. **Switch to the local branch** you want to rename: `git checkout <old_name>`.
2. **Rename the local branch**: `git branch -m <new_name>`.
3. **Push the `<new_name>` local branch** and reset the upstream branch.
4. **Delete the `<old_name>` remote branch**: `git push origin --delete <old_name>`.

Please replace `<old_name>` and `<new_name>` with the actual names of your branches. Be careful when performing these operations as they can affect your repository's history. Always make sure you have a backup or you are sure about what you are doing before running these commands. [@panAnswerHowRename2017]

When resolving git merges, what does `HEAD` mean?

#card 

In Git, the term **HEAD** refers to the current commit you are viewing. By default, when you’re working with a repository, you’ll view the tip of the **master** branch (or the main branch with a different name) unless you’ve switched to another branch. Essentially, **HEAD** points to the most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase. [It’s like a snapshot of your last commit, and it moves along with you as you make new commits or switch branches](https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-a-git-head/)[1](https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-a-git-head/)[2](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/head/).

Additionally, when you switch branches using `git checkout`, **HEAD** changes to point to the tip of the new branch. [If **HEAD** refers to a specific revision that is not associated with a branch name, it is called a **detached HEAD** state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304087/what-is-head-in-git)[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304087/what-is-head-in-git). In summary, think of **HEAD** as a pointer that tracks your current position in the commit history. 🌟

What does `git merge --quit` do?

#card 

The `git merge --quit` command does not exist in Git. It's likely a typo or a misunderstanding of other Git commands used for merging or quitting a merge in progress.

Here are some possibilities:

1. **Meant for `git merge --abort`:** This command aborts a merge in progress and attempts to restore the state of the repository to before the merge started. This is useful if you encounter conflicts during the merge and decide to abandon it.

2. **Meant for exiting a merge conflict resolution:** This depends on the specific editor used for resolving conflicts. In Vim, you can exit with an error message using `cq!`, which will also effectively abort the merge. Other editors might have different escape sequences.

3. **Meant for `git checkout --quit`:** This command is used to discard any uncommitted changes in the working directory and switch back to the previously checked-out branch. However, it doesn't affect an ongoing merge process.

4. **Misinterpretation of `git merge --no-commit`:** This command performs the merge but stops just before creating a merge commit. It allows you to inspect and further modify the merged changes before committing them. However, it doesn't quit the merge process entirely.

If you're unsure what command to use to achieve your desired outcome, it's always best to consult the official Git documentation or seek help from a Git expert.

What is _cherry picking_ in the context of **Git**?

#card 

[In the context of Git, cherry-picking refers to the process of selecting a commit from one branch and applying it to another](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)[1](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick). [This is in contrast to other methods such as merge and rebase, which typically apply many commits to another branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)[1](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick).

Here’s how you can cherry-pick a commit:

1. Make sure you are on the branch you want to apply the commit to:

```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```

2. Execute the following to cherry-pick a commit:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

If you cherry-pick from a public branch, you should consider using `git cherry-pick -x <commit-hash>` to generate a standardized commit message. [This way, you (and your co-workers) can still keep track of the origin of the commit and may avoid merge conflicts in the future](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9339429/what-does-cherry-picking-a-commit-with-git-mean).

Please replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch and `<commit-hash>` with the hash of the commit you want to cherry-pick.

Is the typewriter’s apostrophe, also known as the straight apostrophe (`'`), often recommended over the curly or smart apostrophe (`’`) in Git commit messages? If so, or not, why?

#card 

The typewriter’s apostrophe, also known as the straight apostrophe (`'`), is often recommended over the curly or smart apostrophe (`’`) in Git commit messages for a couple of reasons:

1. **Character Encoding**: Git and many other tools are designed to work best with ASCII, a character encoding standard. [The straight apostrophe is part of the ASCII standard, while the curly apostrophe is not](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44554606/why-does-this-apostrophe-in-my-code-show-up-as-a-in-git-bash) [@sabriAnswerWhyDoes2017]. This means that using a curly apostrophe could lead to unexpected results when your commit message is viewed in different environments.
2. **Command Line Compatibility**: When writing commit messages in the command line, it’s common to wrap the message in single quotes (`git commit -m 'Your message here'`). [If your message includes a curly apostrophe, it could prematurely close the string, causing errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44554606/why-does-this-apostrophe-in-my-code-show-up-as-a-in-git-bash) [@sabriAnswerWhyDoes2017]. Using a straight apostrophe avoids this issue.

Here’s an example of how you might escape a curly apostrophe in a commit message:

```bash
git commit -m 'It\'s a great day for coding!'
```

[In this case, the backslash (`\`) is used to “escape” the straight apostrophe, indicating that it should be treated as a character in the string rather than a delimiter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44554606/why-does-this-apostrophe-in-my-code-show-up-as-a-in-git-bash) [@sabriAnswerWhyDoes2017].

However, it’s worth noting that these issues are largely specific to command-line interfaces and certain programming contexts. [In more general writing contexts, such as in a word processor or on the web, the curly apostrophe is often preferred for its more typographically correct and visually appealing appearance] [@sabriAnswerWhyDoes2017].
