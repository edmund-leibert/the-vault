# Use The Index, Luke!

## 0. Preface

### Developers Need to Index

In general an SQL statement is a straight description of {*what*} is needed without instructions as to {*how*} to get it done.

What does the following SQL query do? 
```sql
SELECT date_of_birth
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'WINAD'
```
#card 
Selects the `date_of_birth` column from the `employees` table where the `last_name` is `'WINAD'`

How would you write a simple SQL statement that selects the `date_of_birth` column from the `employees` table where the `last_name` is `'WINAD'`?
#card 
```sql
SELECT date_of_birth
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'WINAD'
```

Is the following SQL query valid?
```sql
SELECT date_of_birth
WHERE last_name IS 'WINAD'
FROM employees
```
#card 
- No.
	- First, the `IS` keyword is used to test for `NULL` values, not for equality.
	- In a `SELECT` statement, the `FROM` clause must come after the `SELECT` clause and before the `WHERE` clause.

In a `SELECT` statement, must the `FROM` clause come after the `SELECT` clause or before the `WHERE` clause? #card 
Yes.

Is the following a valid SQL template for `SELECT` statements?
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#card 
Yes, this is a correct structure.

What is the most important information for indexing? #card 
How the application queries data.

What does this book cover? #card 
- This book covers everything developers need to know about indexesâ€”and nothing more. 
- To be more precise, the book covers the most important index type only: the *B-tree* index.

Is database indexing a *development* task? #card 
Yes.
