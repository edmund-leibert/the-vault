# Advanced SQL

## Advanced SQL â€” Chapter #05 â€” Video #29 â€” Window functions, frame specifications (ROWSâˆ•RANGEâˆ•GROUPS)

In brief, what exactly are window functions in the context of advanced SQL? #card 
- Window functions are a type of function in SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows, while still returning multiple rows in the result. They are similar to aggregate functions, which also perform calculations across a set of rows, but aggregate functions return a single output row, while window functions return multiple rowsÂ¹.
- Window functions are used with the `OVER` clause, which defines the set of rows (or "window") that the function operates on. The `OVER` clause can include `PARTITION BY`, which divides the rows into partitions or groups, and `ORDER BY`, which specifies the order of rows within each partitionÂ².
- Some common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `SUM()`. For example, you could use the `SUM()` function as a window function to calculate a running total of sales for each month, while still returning a row for each individual saleÂ¹. Window functions can be very powerful and useful for solving complex query challenges in an easy way. Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š

What does the following **sql** code do? 
```sql
SELECT
    date,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM sales_table;
```
#card 
- In this example, we use theÂ `SUM()`Â function as a window function to calculate the running total of sales. TheÂ `OVER`Â clause specifies that the function should operate on the rows in the order specified by theÂ `ORDER BY`Â clause. This means that for each row, theÂ `SUM()`Â function will calculate the sum of sales for all rows up to and including the current row, in the order specified by theÂ `date`Â column.
- The result of this query would be a table with three columns:Â `date`,Â `sales`, andÂ `running_total`. TheÂ `running_total`Â column would show the running total of sales for each record, calculated using the window function.

Lets say that for the following sql, we wished to expand it so that we were calculating the running total for each month, not just for each day. How would we go about that.
```sql
SELECT
    date,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM sales_table;
```
#card 
- In the current example, theÂ `running_total`Â column would show the running total of sales for all rows up to and including the current row, in the order specified by theÂ `date`Â column. So, if theÂ `sales_table`Â contains records for September, October, and November, then the records in October would account for sales in September as well.
- If you want to calculate the running total of sales for each month separately, you can use theÂ `PARTITION BY`Â clause in theÂ `OVER`Â clause to divide the rows into partitions based on the month. Hereâ€™s an example of how you could do that:
```sql
SELECT
    date,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM sales_table;
```
- In this example, we use theÂ `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)`Â function to extract the month from theÂ `date`Â column, and we use this value to partition the rows into groups based on the month. Then, within each partition, we calculate the running total of sales using theÂ `SUM()`Â function as a window function. This way, theÂ `running_total`Â column would show the running total of sales for each month separately.

In sql, what are some common mode of computations? #card 

|SQL Feature|Mode of Computation|
|---|---|
|function|row â†’ row|
|table-generating|row â†’ table of rows|
|aggregate|group of rows â†’ row|
|window function|row vicinity â†’ row (one per row)|
^1690846553022

Window functionsâ€¦ are {1:row-based}: {2:each individual input row `r` is mapped to one result row},
^1690846826482

Window functionsâ€¦ use the {1:vicinity} around {2:`r` to compute this result row}.
^1690846826498

What do window semantics depend on? #card 
They depend on a defined **row ordering**.
^1690847485909

Row vicinity (**window**, frame) is based on eitherâ€¦ 
![[the-vault/assets/images/row-vicinity-window-frames.png|200]]
#card 
1. row **position** (ROWS windows)
2. row values $v_{i}$ (RANGE windows),
3. row **peers** (GROUPS windows)
^1690847485916

If the row ordering is absent then the {vicinity will be random and non-deterministic}.
