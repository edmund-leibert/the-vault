Does C++ support $-\infty$?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes! You can include the `<limits>` library and then call `numeric_limits<T>::infinity()`. Note that the `infinity()` member function of `std::numeric_limits` does _not_ support infinity for some types like `int`, `long long`, etc. 

Can use the member constant `has_infinity` to see if a type supports `infinity()` like so…

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << std::numeric_limits<int>::has_infinity << '\n'
              << std::numeric_limits<long>::has_infinity << '\n'
              << std::numeric_limits<float>::has_infinity << '\n'
              << std::numeric_limits<double>::has_infinity << '\n';
}
```

Possible output:

```
false
false
true
true
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The issue with your code is that `std::max_element` returns an iterator pointing to the maximum element in the range \[first, last) that you passed to it, not the actual maximum value. 

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

float maxValue(const std::vector<float>& numbers) {
    return *std::max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
}
```

In this corrected version, I've also made a small optimization by passing the vector by reference to avoid copying it. This can significantly improve performance for large vectors. The `const` keyword is used to ensure that the function does not modify the input vector. 

Remember, when you use algorithms from the `<algorithm>` library that return an iterator, you often need to dereference the iterator to get the value it's pointing to. In this case, we use the dereference operator (`*`) to get the maximum value from the iterator returned by `std::max_element`.

        max_elem = elem > max_elem ? elem : max_elem;
    }

    return max_elem;
}
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

This code is logically incorrect. The issue is related to the precision of floating point numbers. In your code, you’re using an `int` variable `max_elem` to store the maximum value, which should be a `float`. This can cause precision issues when comparing and assigning floating point numbers. Here’s the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

float maxValue(vector<float> numbers) {
    float max_elem = numeric_limits<float>::lowest();

    for(auto elem : numbers) {
        max_elem = max(elem, max_elem);
    }

    return max_elem;
}
```

In this corrected code, `max_elem` is a `float`, which matches the type of the elements in your vector. The `max()` function from the `<algorithm>` header is used to find the maximum value, which can help avoid precision issues.

What _type_ does `max()` return? What _type_ does `max_element()` return?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

- `ranges::max()`: This function compares two values and returns the maximum value. It does not return an iterator.
- `ranges::max_element()`: This function returns an iterator pointing to the maximum element in a range. If there are multiple maximum elements, it returns the first one. So, you need to dereference the iterator to get the actual value.

Here’s an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Using ranges::max()
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    std::cout << "Max: " << std::ranges::max(a, b) << '\n';  // prints: Max: 10

    // Using ranges::max_element()
    auto it = std::ranges::max_element(v);
    std::cout << "Max Element: " << *it << '\n';  // prints: Max Element: 5

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ranges::max(a, b)` returns the maximum of `a` and `b`, which is `10`. `ranges::max_element(v)` returns an iterator pointing to the maximum element in the vector `v`, which is `5`. We dereference the iterator (`*it`) to get the actual value.

﹇<br>
Why can you do `ranges::max(1,2)`, but for more than comparing two elements we need to use an initializer list? Can you just do `ranges::max(1,2,3,4)` without using the initializer list?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The `ranges::max()` function in C++20 is designed to compare two values and return the maximum. If you want to find the maximum of more than two values, you need to use an initializer list, as in…
```cpp
ranges::max({1, 2, 3, 4})
```

This is because C++ functions can’t natively take a variable number of arguments of any type. There are ways to achieve this using templates and variadic arguments, but these are more complex and not used in the standard library functions.

So, while it might seem more intuitive to write `ranges::max(1, 2, 3, 4)`, this isn’t supported in C++. You need to use an initializer list or another container that holds all the values you want to compare.

﹇<br>
Can `ranges::max()` take multiple arguments?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, the `ranges::max()` function in C++20 can take multiple arguments. It compares all the arguments and returns the maximum value. Here’s an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Max: " << std::ranges::max({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) << '\n';  // prints: Max: 5
    return 0;
}
```

In this example…

```cpp
ranges::max({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
``` 

returns the maximum value in the initializer list `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, which is `5`.

Remember that this function is part of C++20, so you’ll need a compiler that supports C++20 to use it.

What is the difference between `ranges::max()` and` ranges::max_element()`?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The `ranges::max()` and `ranges::max_element()` functions in C++20 are used to find the maximum value in a range, but they do so in slightly different ways:

- `ranges::max(a, b)`: This function compares two values and returns the maximum. If more than two values are given, it returns the maximum value among all the arguments.
	- Here’s an example of using `ranges::max()`:
		```cpp
		#include <iostream>
		#include <ranges>
		
		int main() {
		    int a = 5;
		    int b = 10;
		    std::cout << "Max: " << std::ranges::max(a, b) << '\n';  // prints: Max: 10
		    return 0;
		}
		```
	- In this example, `ranges::max(a, b)` returns the maximum of `a` and `b`, which is `10`.

- `ranges::max_element(first, last)`: This function returns an iterator pointing to the maximum element in the range `[first, last)`. If there are multiple maximum elements, it returns the first one.
	- And here’s an example of using `ranges::max_element()`:
		```cpp
		#include <iostream>
		#include <vector>
		#include <ranges>
		
		int main() {
			std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
			auto it = std::ranges::max_element(v);
			std::cout << "Max Element: " << *it << '\n';  // prints: Max Element: 5
			return 0;
		}
		```
	- In this example, `ranges::max_element(v)` returns an iterator pointing to the maximum element in the vector `v`, which is `5`. We dereference the iterator (`*it`) to get the actual value.

So, if you want to find the maximum value among a few specific values, you can use `ranges::max()`. If you want to find the maximum element in a range of elements (like an array or a vector), you can use `ranges::max_element()`. Remember that `ranges::max_element()` returns an iterator, so you need to dereference it to get the actual value.

Remember that this function is part of C++20, so you’ll need a compiler that supports C++20 to use it.

If I wish to use `ranges` in C++, what must I _always_ make sure to include first?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

First, to use the `ranges` library in C++, you must be using C++20 or later. The `ranges` library is a part of the Standard Library that was added in C++20. It provides facilities for dealing with ranges of values. A range is an object that refers to a sequence of elements, such as an array, a list, or an I/O stream.

To use the `ranges` library, you need to include the `<ranges>` header in your code:

```cpp
#include <ranges>
```

Please make sure your compiler supports C++20 to use this feature. If it doesn’t, you might need to update your compiler or use a different one that does support C++20.

In C++, how can you represent negative or positive infinity?

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- One can use the <span class="spoiler">`limits`</span> library, which is part of the C++ Standard library.
- With that, you can use the function `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` to call postive infinity of the type `int`. 
- If you wanted to negative infinity, you can simply do `-numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` to call negative infinity of the type `int`.

In C++, what is the difference between iterator based loops vs range-`for` loop? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

First and foremost, use range-`for` loops.
- A range-`for` loop uses iterators internally. The loop variable is the *dereferenced value*, not the iterator itself.

What are **containers** in C++?  

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

In C++, containers are data structures that store and organize a collection of objects in memory.

They are parts of the C++ Standard Library and provide a convenient way to manage collections of data, offering different trade-offs in terms of…
- performance
- memory usage
- functionality

What are sequence containers?  

#card-reverse  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Store elements in a linear sequence, where each element has a specific position.

Examples include…
- <span class="spoiler">`std::vector`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A dynamic array that automatically resizes itself whenits capacity is exceeded. It provides fast random access and efficient insertions/deletion at the end, but inertions/deletions in the middle can be slow.</span> 
- <span class="spoiler">`std::list`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A doubly-linked list that allows for fast insertinos and deletions at any position, but does not support random access.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::deque`:</span> <span class="spoiler">A double-ended queue that supports fast random access and efficient insertions/deletions at both the beginning and the end.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::forward_list` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A singly-linked list that allows for fast insertions and deletions at any position, but does not support random access or bidirectional traversal.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::array` (sineC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A fixed-size array with a compile-time size, providing fast random access and a small memory footprint.</span>

What are associative and unordered associative containers?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

These containers store elements in a sorted or hashed manner, which allows for faster access, insertion, and deletion based on specific keys.

Examples include…
- <span class="spoiler">`std::set`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of unique elements, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::multiset`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::map`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of key-value pairs, with unique keys, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::multimap`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::map`, but allows multiple key-value pairs with the same key.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::unordered_set` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A hashed collection of unique elements, providing average constant-time access, insertion, and deletion.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">`std::unordered_multiset` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::unordered_set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>

What are some key benefits of containers in C++?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

These containers provide various iterator types that allow you to traverse and manipulate the elements in a uniform manner.

Additionally, they are designed to worth with C++ standard library algorithms, which makes it easy to perform common operations such as…
- <span class="spoiler">searching elements</span>
- <span class="spoiler">sorting elements</span>

In C++, what is an input iterator?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

A type of iterator that allows you to traverse a container in a read-only, forward direction.
- It is the most basic iterator category in theC++ Standard Library
- Provides the minimum functionality required for single-pass algorithms, like reading elements from an input stream, or iterating through elements of a container in a linear fashion.

To provide more context, an input iterator is a type of iterator that is part of a collection/new way of organizing iterators called “[Iterator concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator).”
- While, I am still unsure about what the difference is between an `input_iterator` and a `output_iterator`, we need not concern ourselves for now.
