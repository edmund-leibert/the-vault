In C++, what is a **string literal**?

#anki-card-reverse #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Also, known as an anonymous string, is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code.

Is essentially text between double quotes
- For example: `"Hey World"`

Should I use `strcat()`?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

No, `strcat()` is considered unsafe. 

This is because there is nothing to stop you from `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence buffer, with undefined results up to and including…

- heap corruption
- stack corruption
- program exit
- even somebody owning your machine if the data past the 100th byte is appropriately constructed.
	- This is a common class of security vulnerability called a buffer overflow

To avoid this, use `std::string`’s operator+

﹇<br>
What is a **buffer overflow**?

#anki-card-reverse #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

When you input more data that the buffer allows. For example, consider `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence. As a result, the remaining input data *“overflows”* to the rest of your memory.

What do you notice about the below code?

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "Hello");
    strcat(buffer, ", World!"); // buffer overflow here
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

In this example, `buffer` is an array of 10 characters, but we’re trying to concatenate a string of 13 characters into it using `strcat()`. This causes a buffer overflow because `strcat()` doesn’t check the size of the destination buffer and writes past the end of it.

What is the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`?  

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

`strcpy()` and `strcat()` are both functions used to manipulate strings in C and C++. They are both defined in the `string.h` header file.

- `strcpy()` is used to copy a string from one location to another. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the copied string will be stored, and a source string that will be copied. The function copies the entire source string (including the null character) to the destination buffer.
- `strcat()` is used to concatenate two strings. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the concatenated string will be stored, and a source string that will be appended to the end of the destination string. The function appends the entire source string (including the null character) to the end of the destination string.

Here’s an example that demonstrates the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`:
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello";
    char str2[20] = ", World!";
    char str3[20];
    strcpy(str3, str1); // str3 now contains "Hello"
    strcat(str3, str2); // str3 now contains "Hello, World!"
    std::cout << str3 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `str1` is an array of characters initialized with the string `"Hello"`, and `str2` is an array of characters initialized with the string `", World!"`. `str3` is an array of 20 characters. The first call to `strcpy()` copies the contents of `str1` into `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello"`. The call to `strcat()` appends the contents of `str2` to the end of `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello, World!"`.

Is JavaScript a **compiled** or **interpreted** language? 

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

Neither. JavaScript defies classification because at a very technical level it is compiled before being interpreted by the browser line by line.

Some still classify JavaScript as an interpreted language…
- For instance, an article from Stanford states that JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More *modern* browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

What is the `module` keyword in Node.js?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

The `module` keyword is an object representing the current module or file in the **CommonJS** module system used in Node.js for handling modularization.

In Node.js, the `module` keyword refers to a special object representing the current module being executed. This object provides various properties and methods for accessing information about the module and manipulating its exports.

**Here is an example demonstrating the use of the `module` keyword**:

```javascript
// file: myModule.js

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// Export the greet function using the module.exports object
module.exports.greet = greet;

// You can also export multiple functions or objects
module.exports.goodbye = function () {
  return 'Goodbye!';
};
```

In this example, the `myModule.js` file defines two functions: `greet` and `goodbye`. These functions are then exported using the `module.exports` object.

**Importing and using the `myModule.js` functions**:

Here's an example of another JavaScript file importing the `myModule.js` functions and using them:

```javascript
// file: app.js

const myModule = require('./myModule'); // Import the myModule.js file

// Use the exported functions from myModule
const greeting = myModule.greet('John');
const farewell = myModule.goodbye();

console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, John"
console.log(farewell); // Output: "Goodbye!"
```

This code imports the `myModule.js` file using the `require` function. It then accesses the exported functions `greet` and `goodbye` using the dot notation. Finally, it calls these functions and prints their outputs to the console.

This demonstrates the basic process of importing and using functions defined in a separate module in Node.js. You can apply this concept to modularize your code and make it more organized and reusable.

**Another way to export the `greet` function would be**:

```javascript
export const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
```

This way utilizes the ECMAScript Module syntax, which is available since Node.js 13.

**Here is another example that demonstrates accessing the current module's filename and directory**:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const modulePath = module.path; // Path to the current module file
const moduleDir = path.dirname(modulePath); // Directory of the current module

console.log(`Module path: ${modulePath}`);
console.log(`Module directory: ${moduleDir}`);
```

This code uses the `path` module to extract the path and directory information from the `module.path` property.

These are just a few basic examples of using the `module` keyword in Node.js. For more information, you can refer to the official Node.js documentation:

- **CommonJS modules:** [https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)
- **ECMAScript modules:** [https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html)

What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

The `module.exports` is a property of the `module` object used to export functions, objects, or variables from the current module, making them accessible to other modules.

**Here is an example demonstrating the use of the `module.exports` property**:

```javascript
// file: myModule.js

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// Export the greet function using the module.exports object
module.exports.greet = greet;

// You can also export multiple functions or objects
module.exports.goodbye = function () {
  return 'Goodbye!';
};
```

In this example, the `myModule.js` file defines two functions: `greet` and `goodbye`. These functions are then exported using the `module.exports` object.

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript 

JavaScript's primitive types include:
1.  `String`: Represents a sequence of characters, such as `"Hello, world!"`.
2.  `Number`: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., `42` or `3.14`.
3.  `BigInt`: Represents integers of arbitrary length, e.g., `9007199254740991n`.
4.  `Boolean`: Represents a true or false value, e.g., `true` or `false`.
5.  `Null`: Represents a value that intentionally has no value or reference, e.g., `null`.
6.  `Undefined`: Represents a value that has not been assigned, e.g., `undefined`.
7.  `Symbol`: Represents a unique and immutable value, typically used as object property keys, e.g., `Symbol('description')`.

How does JavaScript implement inheritance? 

#anki-card-reverse #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it uses a **prototypical** inheritance.

This is instead of **classical** inheritance as seen in languages like Java or C++.

﹇<br>
In the context of JavaScript, what is the difference between **prototypical** and **classical** inheritance?

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript 

First and foremost, _any_ object-oriented code you write in JavaScript is a paradigm of prototypal inheritance. JavaScript simply doesn't have classical inheritance. This should clear things up a bit:

```console
                                   Inheritance
                                        |
                         +-----------------------------+
                         |                             |
                         v                             v
                    Prototypal                     Classical
                         |
         +------------------------------+
         |                              |
         v                              v
Prototypal Pattern             Constructor Pattern
```

As you can see prototypal inheritance and classical inheritance are two different paradigms of inheritance. Some languages like Self, Lua and JavaScript support prototypal inheritance. However most languages like C++, Java and C# support classical inheritance.

---

<u><b>A Quick Overview of Object-Oriented Programming</b></u>

Both prototypal inheritance and classical inheritance are object-oriented programming paradigms (i.e. they deal with objects). Objects are simply abstractions which encapsulate the properties of a real world entity (i.e. they represent real word things in the program). This is known as abstraction.

**Abstraction:** The representation of real world things in computer programs.

_Theoretically an abstraction is defined as "a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples". However for the sake of this explanation we're going to use the aforementioned definition instead._

Now some objects have a lot of things in common. For example a mud bike and a Harley Davidson have a lot in common.

**A mud bike:**

![A mud bike.|250](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sk20o.jpg)

**A Harley Davidson:**

![A Harley Davidson|250](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hj6K.jpg)

A mud bike and a Harley Davidson are both bikes. Hence a bike is a generalization of both a mud bike and a Harley Davidson.

```console
                   Bike
                     |
    +---------------------------------+
    |                                 |
    v                                 v
Mud Bike                       Harley Davidson
```

In the above example the bike, the mud bike and the Harley Davidson are all abstractions. However the bike is a more general abstraction of the mud bike and the Harley Davidson (i.e. both the mud bike and the Harley Davidson are specific types of bikes).

**Generalization:** An abstraction of a more specific abstraction.

In object-oriented programming we create objects (which are abstractions of real world entities) and we use either classes or prototypes to create generalizations of these objects. Generalizations are created via inheritance. A bike is a generalization of a mud bike. Hence mud bikes inherit from bikes.

<u><b>Classical Object-Oriented Programming</b></u>

In classical object-oriented programming we have two types of abstractions: classes and objects. An object, as mentioned before, is an abstraction of a real world entity. A class on the other hand is an abstraction of an object or another class (i.e. it's a generalization). For example, consider:

```console
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
| Level of Abstraction | Name of Entity |                Comments               |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
| 0                    | John Doe       | Real World Entity.                    |
| 1                    | johnDoe        | Variable holding object.              |
| 2                    | Man            | Class of object johnDoe.              |
| 3                    | Human          | Superclass of class Man.              |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
```

As you can see in classical object-oriented programming languages objects are only abstractions (i.e. all objects have an abstraction level of 1) and classes are only generalizations (i.e. all classes have an abstraction level greater than 1).

Objects in classical object-oriented programming languages can only be created by instantiating classes:

```javascript
class Human {
    // ...
}

class Man extends Human {
    // ...
}

Man johnDoe = new Man();
```

In summation in classical object-oriented programming languages objects are abstractions of real world entities and classes are generalizations (i.e. abstractions of either objects or other classes).

Hence as the level of abstraction increases entities become more general and as the level of abstraction decreases entities become more specific. In this sense the level of abstraction is analogous to a scale ranging from more specific entities to more general entities.

<u><b>Prototypal Object-Oriented Programming</b></u>

Prototypal object-oriented programming languages are much simpler than classical object-oriented programming languages because in prototypal object-oriented programming we only have one type of abstraction (i.e. objects). For example, consider:

```console
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
| Level of Abstraction | Name of Entity |                Comments               |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
| 0                    | John Doe       | Real World Entity.                    |
| 1                    | johnDoe        | Variable holding object.              |
| 2                    | man            | Prototype of object johnDoe.          |
| 3                    | human          | Prototype of object man.              |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+
```

As you can see in prototypal object-oriented programming languages objects are abstractions of either real world entities (in which case they are simply called objects) or other objects (in which case they are called prototypes of those objects that they abstract). Hence a prototype is a generalization.

Objects in prototypal object-oriented programming languages may be created either ex-nihilo (i.e. out of nothing) or from another object (which becomes the prototype of the newly created object):

```javascript
var human = {};
var man = Object.create(human);
var johnDoe = Object.create(man);
```

In my humble opinion prototypal object-oriented programming languages are more powerful than classical object-oriented programming languages because:

1. There is only one type of abstraction.
2. Generalizations are simply objects.

By now you must have realized the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance. Classical inheritance is limited to classes inheriting from other classes. However prototypal inheritance includes not only prototypes inheriting from other prototypes but also objects inheriting from prototypes.

<u><b>Prototype-Class Isomorphism</b></u>

You must have noticed that prototypes and classes are very similar. That's true. They are. In fact they are so similar that you can actually use prototypes to model classes:

```javascript
function CLASS(base, body) {
    if (arguments.length < 2) body = base, base = Object.prototype;
    var prototype = Object.create(base, {new: {value: create}});
    return body.call(prototype, base), prototype;

    function create() {
        var self = Object.create(prototype);
        return prototype.hasOwnProperty("constructor") &&
            prototype.constructor.apply(self, arguments), self;
    }
}
```

Using the above `CLASS` function you can create prototypes that look like classes:

```javascript
var Human = CLASS(function () {
    var milliseconds = 1
      , seconds      = 1000 * milliseconds
      , minutes      = 60 * seconds
      , hours        = 60 * minutes
      , days         = 24 * hours
      , years        = 365.2425 * days;

    this.constructor = function (name, sex, dob) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sex = sex;
        this.dob = dob;
    };

    this.age = function () {
        return Math.floor((new Date - this.dob) / years);
    };
});

var Man = CLASS(Human, function (Human) {
    this.constructor = function (name, dob) {
        Human.constructor.call(this, name, "male", dob);
        if (this.age() < 18) throw new Error(name + " is a boy, not a man!");
    };
});

var johnDoe = Man.new("John Doe", new Date(1970, 0, 1));
```

The reverse is not true however (i.e. you can't use classes to model prototypes). This is because prototypes are objects but classes are not objects. They are an entirely different type of abstraction.

<u><b>Conclusion</b></u>

In summation we learned that an abstraction is a _"a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples"_ and that generalization is _"an abstraction of a more specific abstraction"_. We also learned about the differences between prototypal and classical inheritance and how both of them are two faces of the same coin.

On a parting note I would like to remark that there are two patterns of prototypal inheritance: the prototypal pattern and the constructor pattern. The prototypal pattern is the canonical pattern of prototypal inheritance whereas the constructor pattern is used to make prototypal inheritance look more like classical inheritance. Personally I prefer the prototypal pattern. [@shahAnswerClassicalInheritance2013]

What happens when an object is created in JavaScript? 

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

When an object is created in JavaScript, it gets an internal reference to its "prototype" object. 
- This prototype object is used to look up properties and methods that are not directly defined on the object itself. 
- If a requested property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript will search the prototype chain, which is a series of connected prototype objects, until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (which is `null`).

For example, when you create an array in JavaScript, it is an instance of the `Array` constructor:
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
```
This array instance has access to methods like `push`, `pop`, and `slice`. 

These methods are not defined directly on the `arr` object but are instead defined on the `Array.prototype` object. 
- When you call a method on `arr`, JavaScript looks up the method in the prototype chain, ultimately finding it on `Array.prototype`.

Is using prototypes efficient? 

#anki-card-reverse #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

Using <span class="spoiler">prototypes</span> allows for more efficient memory usage.

This is because shared <span class="spoiler">properties</span> and methods are defined only once on the <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>, rather than on each instance of the object.

This also makes it easy to extend or modify the behavior of all instances of a constructor, by simply modifying the constructor’s <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>.
