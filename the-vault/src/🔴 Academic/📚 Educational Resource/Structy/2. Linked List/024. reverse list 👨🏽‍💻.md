## 2. Linked List

### **024. reverse list 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for the problem? 
#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
 - **Approach:** 
	1. First consider the following base cases…
		1. Consider the case where `head` is a `nullptr`; just return `nullptr`
		2. Consider the case where the linked list is of length 1; just return `head`;
	2. Now the general case…
		1. Create and set `dummy` to `nullptr` (the position *before* the beginning)
		2. Create and set `next_node` to `head->next` (the position *after* the beginning)
		3. Now iterate while `head` does not equal `nullptr`…
			1. Set `head->next` to equal `dummy`
			2. Set `dummy` equal to `head`
			3. Set `head` to equal `next_node`
			4. Set `next_node` equal to `head->next`
			5. If `next_node` is equal to `nullptr` (it is at the end of the original list/beginning of the “new” reversed list)
				1. Set `head->next` to `dummy`
				2. Return `head`
- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### Attempt #1 (2023-02-08) ⏲️

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
#include <string>
class Node {
  public:
    std::string val;
    Node* next;
    Node(std::string initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  // Base where list is empty
  if(head == nullptr) {
    return nullptr;
  }
  // Base case where length of list is 1 
  if(head->next = nullptr) {
    return head;
  }
  // Begin general case
  Node* ans = head;
  Node* dummy = nullptr;
  Node* next_node = head->next;
  while(head != nullptr) {
    head->next = dummy;
    dummy = head;
    head = next_node;
    next_node = head->next;
    if(next_node == nullptr) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```

While the code is valid, and will compile, it is not logically sound.
- After you reverse a linked list, you will already be at the end of the original list (i.e., start of the “new” reversed list). By returning `ans`, you are just returning the *end* of your “new” reversed linked list.
- Also, you are setting the `head` to point to `nullptr` in the base case where length of list is $1$. **Make sure to *never* use assignment operators when dealing with expression for conditional checks!!!**

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
#include <string>
class Node {
public:
    std::string val;
    Node* next;
    Node(std::string initialVal) {
        val = initialVal;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    // todo
    // Base where list is empty
    if(head == nullptr) {
        return nullptr;
    }
    // Base case where length of list is 1
    if(head->next == nullptr) {
        return head;
    }
    // Begin general case
    Node* dummy = nullptr;
    Node* next_node = head->next;
    while(head != nullptr) {
        head->next = dummy;
        dummy = head;
        head = next_node;
        next_node = head->next;
        if(next_node == nullptr) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```

While the following code is valid, it is not logically correct.
- When `next_node` arrives at the end of the linked list (i.e., `next_node` is equal to `nullptr`), we need to remember to set `head`’s `next` values to equal to `dummy`.

Yes the following code is **valid** and logically correct. 
^1691045339958

When doing the in-place three pointer approach, are these the correct steps for the general case?
1. Now the general case…
	1. Create and set `dummy` to `nullptr` (the position *before* the beginning)
	2. Create and set `next_node` to `head->next` (the position *after* the beginning)
	3. Now iterate while `head` does not equal `nullptr`…
		1. Set `head->next` to equal `dummy`
		2. Set `head` to equal `next_node`
		3. Set `next_node` equal to `head->next`
		4. If `next_node` is equal to `nullptr` (it is at the end of the original list/beginning of the “new” reversed list)
			1. Return `head`
#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
- No! We forget to set `dummy` equal to `head` *right after* changing where `head->next` points too.
- We also forgot to consider changing `head->next` to `dummy` when `next_node` is equal to `nullptr`.
