## 2. Linked List

### **018. linked list intro 👨🏻‍🏫**

What is happens under the hood when wishing to insert the element `2` at position 2 in the array `[1,2,3,4,5]`?  
[#card](app://obsidian.md/index.html#card) [#🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp](app://obsidian.md/index.html#domain/computer-science/programming-language/cpp)  
- The array first has to shift all the elements from position 2 to the end right by 1. Then it can insert `2` into the new empty cell of the array at position 2.  
- If the array does _not_ have enough allocated space, then it will also have to allocate more space to the object.

What is the worst-case time complexity of insertion for an array?

No, just the head node.
