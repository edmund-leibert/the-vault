## 2. Linked List

### **020. linked list values 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal** solution to this problem? 
#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the iterative approach.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
⚠️ Below not optimal, for review purposes only…
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the recursive approach and make sure to have your recursive function be formatted correctly.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-01-08) ⏲️ 00:06:20**

Do in-place operations on Node value happen at the start or end of the linked list? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Depends on if the operation happens **before** *or* **after** the recursive call…
- Before: We start at the front of the linked list.
- End: We start at the end of the linked list.

##### **Attempt #2 (2023-01-08) ⏲️ 00:07:00** 

Is the optimal approach to these types of linked list problems iterative _or_ recursive? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
The optimal solution to these types of problems is iterative.
