## 2. Linked List

### **021. sum list**

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal** solution to this problem? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach:** 
	1. Declare an `int` that will serve as our running total holder.
	2. Then simply iterate across the linked list and add each node’s value to the running total holder.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
⚠️ Below not optimal, for review purposes only…
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the recursive approach and make sure to have your recursive function be formatted correctly.
	2. Your recursive function does not need to have another argument for the sum, can just return the running sum.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-01-08) ⏲️ 00:07:00**

What is the basic structure of a recursive function? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
1. Base case
2. `else-if` and `else` statements for all other conditions
	1. Call the the recursive functions first
	2. Then work “backwards” from the end and return the value at that point to the earlier stack.

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node(int initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
int recursiveSumList(Node* head, int sum) {
  if (head == nullptr) {
    sum += 0;
    return sum;
  }
  else {
    int prevSum = recursiveSumList(head->next, sum);
    sum += head->val + prevSum;
    return sum;
  }
}
int sumList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  int sum {0};
  sum = recursiveSumList(head, sum);
 
  return sum;
}
```
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Yes, but it is **not** optimal. Beside it being the recursive approach…
	- You do **not** need the parameter `sum` for your recursive function. You can simply “build” the sum values by returning them and then adding them to the “current” stack’s node value as we move back up the linked list.
- Example of optimized code...
```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node(int initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
int recurisveSumList(Node* node) {
  if(node == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  else {
    return recurisveSumList(node->next) + node->val;
  }
}
int sumList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  int sum = recurisveSumList(head);
  return sum;
}
```
Remember that the optimal approach is to traverse the linked list iteratively.

What is the naming of helper function in C++? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
There is really no set naming convention, but you should just prefix all helper functions with an underscore (i.e., ‘\_’).
^1690931237767


What is the difference between **helper functions** and utility functions? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Helper functions** 
	- Can be instantiated.
	- Can have instance variables and also have both instance and static methods, while utility functions only have static variables and methods.
- **Utility functions**
	- Cannot be instantiated because they have a private constructor. 
	- Utility functions often have a global scope within an application, while helper functions are always given a package scope.
^1690931237771

Why is should we always attempt to go with the **iterative** approach first _instead_ of the **recursive** approach? 
#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Iterative approaches to linked list problems are generally preferred over recursive approaches because they have a lower space complexity.
- This is because recursive approaches require the use of the call tack, which can grow quite large for long linked lists.
