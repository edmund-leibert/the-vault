#### 📽️ Walkthrough

##### C++

﹇<br>
Does `to_string` work for all numeric types?

#card 

Yes, the `to_string` function works for all numeric types. In C++, the `std::to_string` function can convert the following numeric types to a string<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string)</sup>:

- `int`
- `long`
- `long long`
- `unsigned`
- `unsigned long`
- `unsigned long long`
- `float`
- `double`
- `long double`

The function converts a numeric value to a string as if by using the `std::sprintf` function with the appropriate format specifier<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string)</sup>.

	      }

Is the following snippet valid?

```cpp
auto char_occur = std::distance(itR, itL);
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

While the snippet will compile, it is _logically_ **incorrect** if you tend to calculate the _positive_ distance from `itL` (inclusive) to `itR` (exclusive).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main() 
{
    std::vector
    std::cout << "distance(first, last) = "
              << std::distance(v.begin(), v.end()) << '\n'
              << "distance(last, first) = "
              << std::distance(v.end(), v.begin()) << '\n';
              // the behavior is undefined (until LWG940)
 
    static constexpr auto il = {3, 1, 4};
    // Since C++17 `distance` can be used in constexpr context.
    static_assert(std::distance(il.begin(), il.end()) == 3);
    static_assert(std::distance(il.end(), il.begin()) == -3);
}
```

Output:

```
distance(first, last) = 3
distance(last, first) = -3
```

No, the member function `append()` does not support appending a `char` to a `std::string`. 
- To do so, one should instead use `push_back()`
- Note that the `+=` sign also works for appending and it supports _both_ `char` and `std::string`

﹇<br>
Does the `std::string.push_back()` method, like `std::string.append()` have an overload that allows you to specify the number of times you want to push a character to the end of the string?

#card 

No, the `std::string.push_back()` method does not have an overload that allows you to specify the number of times you want to push a character to the end of the string. The `push_back` function in the C++ Standard Library's `std::string` class is intended to append a single character to the end of the string.

Here's how you use it:

```cpp
std::string str = "Hello";
str.push_back('!');
// str is now "Hello!"
```

If you want to append the same character multiple times, you would typically use a loop:

```cpp
std::string str;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    str.push_back('a');
}
// str will be "aaaaa"
```

Alternatively, if you want to append multiple instances of the same character, you can use the `std::string::append` method, which does have an overload that takes a character and a count:

```cpp
std::string str;
str.append(5, 'a');
// str will be "aaaaa"
```

This `append` method can achieve the same effect as calling `push_back` multiple times but in a more concise manner.

Is the following valid syntax?

```

Yes.

Is the following code valid?

```cpp
result.push_back(static_cast<int>(std::distance(itF, itB)));
```

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

The code is using `push_back()` to push an `int` into a string of elements char. Should simply call `to_string` and use the `append()` function.

Is the following code valid?

```

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

No, it is not. If you wish to use a value that was declared, outside the scope of the statement in your lambda function, you ***must specify it***.

```cpp
auto itSubEnd = std::find_if_not(it, s.end(), [it](char ch) { return ch == *it; });

In modern C++, what is the modern way to convert an `int` to a string? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Use the `std::string()` functions from the `<string>` library.

How many parameters does `substr()` have? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

It has 2 parameters.
- **pos** - position of the first character to include
- **count** - length of substring

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1694808611495


﹇<br>
In modern C++, how can you get a substring from a `std::string` when I wish to do so by using the two iterators which already point to positions in the string I wish to copy from? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

I can simply use the `std::string` constructor. For example…

```cpp
std::string s = "Hello, world!";
auto it1 = s.begin() + 7;
auto it2 = it1 + 5;
std::string subString(it1, it2);
std::cout << subString << std::endl; // Outputs "world"
```

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1694808611498


﹇<br>
In the following code, is `subString` a **deep** or **shallow** copy? 

```cpp
std::string s = "Hello, world!";
auto it1 = s.begin() + 7;
auto it2 = it1 + 5;
std::string subString(it1, it2);
std::cout << subString << std::endl; // Outputs "world"
```

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

It is a **deep** copy. When using the `std::string` constructor, it creates a deep copy.
