What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- **Official Structy Solution**: using a hashmap (unordered_map)

	```cpp
	#include <string>
	#include <unordered_map>
	
	char mostFrequentChar(std::string s) {
	  std::unordered_map<char, int> count;
	  for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 1) {
	    count[s[i]] += 1;
	  }
	  
	  char best = '\0';
	  for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 1) {
	    char current = s[i];
	    if (best == '\0' || count[current] > count[best]) {
	      best = current;
	    }
	  }
	  return best;
	}
	```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
Is it _safe_ to do the following in C++ if `elem` does not exist in the `unordered_map` yet?

```cpp
sMap[elem] = sMap[elem] + 1; 
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, it is safe to do so.

In C++, when you access an element of an `unordered_map` using the `[]` operator, if the key does not exist in the map, it will be default constructed and inserted into the map. 
- For integral types like `int`, the default constructor initializes the value to zero. So, `sMap[elem]` will be `0` if `elem` does not exist in the map, and `sMap[elem] = sMap[elem] + 1;` will correctly set its value to `1`. 
- However, please note that this behavior is specific to C++ and may _not_ apply to other programming languages.

Is it _performant_ to do the following in C++ if `elem` does not exist in the `unordered_map` yet?

```cpp
sMap[elem] = sMap[elem] + 1; 
```

For example, will I still have a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ access with this approach?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, it’s relatively safe and efficient. 

The `unordered_map` in C++ is implemented as a hash table, and its `operator[]` has an average time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. When you use `sMap[elem]`, it will either return the value for `elem` if it exists, or insert…

```cpp
{elem, 0}
```

…into the map if it does not exist. This insertion operation also has an average time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. 

Therefore, the statement `sMap[elem] = sMap[elem] + 1;` will have an average time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. 

However, please note that in the worst-case scenario (when a hash collision occurs), the time complexity could be $\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the map.

###### Notes


﹇<br>
When building a `std::map` from the elements from a string, what is something I should I keep in mind? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Need to remember that iterating across the string to access key-values in the new built map still ends up with a time complexity being $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

What should be default value for objects of type `char`? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Should be set to the **null character** (i.e., `'\0'`).

What is the **null character** in C++? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

An artifact from C, the **null character** (i.e., `\0`) is used to mark the end of C-style strings.

What is wrong with the following code?

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <utility>
#include <map>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;
char mostFrequentChar(std::string s) {
    // todo
    std::map<char,std::pair<int,int>> mapS; // 1st: numOccur 2nd: pos
    for(auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); it++) {
        if(mapS.find(*it) != mapS.end()) {
            mapS[*it] = make_pair(mapS[*it].first + 1, mapS[*it].second);
        }
        else {
            mapS[*it] =  make_pair(1, std::distance(s.begin(),it) );
        }
    }
    // Find now the max
    char maxChar = 'a';
    int currMax = -std::numeric_limits<int>::infinity();
    int currEarliestPos = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    for(auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); it++) {
        if(mapS[*it].first > currMax ) {
            maxChar = *it;
            currMax = mapS[*it].first;
            currEarliestPos = mapS[*it].second;
        }
        else if (mapS[*it].first == currMax && mapS[*it].second < currEarliestPos) {
            maxChar = *it;
            currMax = mapS[*it].first;
            currEarliestPos = mapS[*it].second;
        }
    }
    return maxChar;
}
void run() {
    // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
    // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Nothing wrong with the code, however it is unnecessarily efficient. Remember that we are going to do another iteration across the string to determine which `char` is the earliest and has the maximum number of occurrences. As such, we only need to include in our `map` the number of occurrence, not also the position of the char. When we iterate again across the input string we can set the answer `char` to the current iterating element if it has a strictly larger number of occurrences than the current.

P.S. Should use `unordered_map`
