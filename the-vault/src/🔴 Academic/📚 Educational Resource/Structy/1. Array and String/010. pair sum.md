#### Solution (C++)

﹇<br>
What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- **Official Structy Solution**: using a hashmap (unordered_map)

	```cpp
	#include <array> 
	#include <vector> 
	#include <unordered_map> 
	
	std::array<int, 2> pairSum(std::vector<int> numbers, int target) { 
		std::unordered_map<int, int> previousNums;
		for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i += 1) {
			int complement = target - numbers[i];
			if (previousNums.count(complement) > 0) {
				return std::array<int, 2> {
					i, previousNums[complement] };
				}
			previousNums[numbers[i]] = i;
		}
	}
	```

	- n = size of vector
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(n)

```cpp
std::array<int, 2> pairSum(std::vector<int> numbers, int target) {
    unordered_map<int,int> numMap; // Elem, Pos
    // Iterate across and store for each elem its position
    auto it = numbers.begin();

    // Iterate again across and for each elem, find if its pair exists
    while(it != numbers.end()) {
        if(numMap.find(*it) == numMap.end()) {
            numMap[*it] = static_cast<int>( std::distance(numbers.begin(), it) );
        }

        // Check to see complement value for target already exsits
        if(numMap.find(target - *it) != numMap.end()) {
            if(numMap[target - *it] != static_cast<int>(std::distance(numbers.begin(), it))) {
                return {numMap[target - *it], static_cast<int>(std::distance(numbers.begin(), it))};
            }
        }

        it++;
    }


    return { };
}
```

What is happening in the return lines of this code? Does the brackets {} work for only std::array or could it work also if the return type defined in the signature of the function was a std::vector?

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

In the return lines of this code, the `{}` brackets are being used to create an `std::array` with two elements. This is known as list initialization (or uniform initialization) in C++. The two elements of the array are the indices of the two numbers in the input vector that add up to the target value.

This syntax works not only for `std::array`, but also for many other types in C++, including `std::vector`. If you change the return type of the function to `std::vector<int>`, you can still use `{}` to create a vector. For example:

```cpp
return {num1, num2};
```

This will create a vector with two elements, `num1` and `num2`. However, keep in mind that while `std::array` has a fixed size, `std::vector` is dynamic and can change its size at runtime.

###### Notes

﹇<br>
What is the return type of `std::distance()`? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Should just be an `int`, but when using it in `std::array<int>{}`, need to `static_cast<int>()` the return type of `std::distance()`.

﹇<br>
Is the following snippet of code valid? 

```cpp
if(numMap.find(*it) != numMap.end()) {
	numMap[*it] = static_cast<int>( std::distance(numbers.begin(), it) );
}
```

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- Yes, the following code snippet is valid, but *logically* wrong.
- If your **intention** is to insert `*it` if it is not currently in `numMap` then you want to change your condition in your `if` statement to…

```cpp
if(numMap.find(*it) == numMap.end) { // <- Means *it not found in numMap
// ...
}
```
