What is the two pointer method?

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- The two pointer is a common method for easily finding a subsegment of a larger segment.
- Generally, it has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$

What is a hash map?

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- As associative container in which each element is a pair with the pair being represented by either a key or a value.

What is a hash set?

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- A hash set is essentially just a container that can only contain unique elements.

What is the difference between hash map and hash set?

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Here’s an example in C++ that demonstrates the difference between a hash map and a hash set:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
int main() {
    // Create a hash map with string keys and int values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> map;
    map["apple"] = 1;
    map["banana"] = 2;
    map["orange"] = 3;
    // Print the key-value pairs in the hash map
    std::cout << "Hash map:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& pair : map) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }
    // Create a hash set with string elements
    std::unordered_set<std::string> set;
    set.insert("apple");
    set.insert("banana");
    set.insert("orange");
    // Print the elements in the hash set
    std::cout << "Hash set:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& element : set) {
        std::cout << element << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a hash map with string keys and int values, and inserts three key-value pairs into the map. It then creates a hash set with string elements, and inserts three elements into the set. Finally, it prints the contents of both the hash map and the hash set.

The output of this code might look like this:

```
Hash map:
banana: 2
orange: 3
apple: 1
Hash set:
banana
orange
apple
```

As you can see, the hash map stores key-value pairs, while the hash set stores only unique elements.
