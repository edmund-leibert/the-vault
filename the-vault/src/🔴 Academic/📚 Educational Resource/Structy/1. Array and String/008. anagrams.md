What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

- **Approach #1: Using only _one_ map**
	```cpp
	bool anagrams(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
	    unordered_map<char, int> s1map;
	    for (auto s1_char: s1) {
	        s1map[s1_char] = (s1map.find(s1_char) == s1map.end()) ? 1 : s1map[s1_char] + 1;
	    }
	    for (auto s2_char: s2) {
	        if (s1map.find(s2_char) != s1map.end()) {
	            s1map[s2_char] = s1map[s2_char] - 1;
	        } else {
	            return false;
	        }
	    }
	    for (auto s1_char: s1) {
	        if (s1map[s1_char] == 0) {
	        } else {
	            return false;
	        }
	    }
	    // todo
	    return true;
	}
	```
- The given program checks if two strings are anagrams by counting the frequency of each character in the first string and then decrementing the count for each character in the second string. If all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams.
	- The **time complexity** of this program is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the strings. This is because each character in both strings is visited once.
	- The **space complexity** of this program is **O(1)**. Although a hash map is used, the number of keys in the map is bounded by the size of the alphabet. In case of ASCII characters, there are 128 possible characters, and in case of extended ASCII, there are 256 possible characters. Therefore, the space complexity is constant as it does not change with the size of the input string.

- **Official Structy Solution**
	```cpp
	bool anagrams(std::string s1, std::string s2) {  
	    unordered_map<char, int> s1map;  
	    for (auto s1_char: s1) {  
	        s1map[s1_char] = (s1map.find(s1_char) == s1map.end()) ? 1 : s1map[s1_char] + 1;  
	    }  
	    for (auto s2_char: s2) {  
	        if (s1map.find(s2_char) != s1map.end()) {  
	            s1map[s2_char] = s1map[s2_char] - 1;  
	        } else {  
	            return false;  
	        }  
	    }  
	    for (auto s1_char: s1) {  
	        if (s1map[s1_char] == 0) {  
	        } else {  
	            return false;  
	        }  
	    }  
	    // todo  
	    return true;  
	}
	```
	- n = length of string 1
	- m = length of string 2
	- Time: O(n + m)
	- Space: O(n + m)

###### Notes

﹇<br>
What is the space complexity of using a hash map when the input is only alphabetical `char`s?

#card 

In such cases, we can state that the space complexity to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Although a hash map is used, the number of keys in the map is bounded by the size of the alphabet. In case of ASCII characters, there are 128 possible characters, and in case of extended ASCII, there are 256 possible characters. Therefore, the space complexity is constant as it does not change with the size of the input string.

Is the following code valid?

```cpp
bool anagrams(std::string s1, std::string s2) {  
    unordered_map<char,int> s1map;  
  
    for(auto s1_char : s1) {  
        s1map[s1_char] = (s1map.find(s1_char) == s1map.end()) ? 1 : s1map[s1_char] + 1;  
    }  
  
    for(auto s2_char : s2) {  
        if(s1map.find(s2_char) != s1map.end()) {  
            s1map[s2_char] = s1map[s2_char] - 1;  
        }  
        else {  
            return false;  
        }  
    }  
  
    for(auto s2_char : s2) {  
        if(s1map[s2_char] == 0) {  
            return true;  
        }  
        else {  
            return false;  
        }  
    }  
  
    // todo  
    return true;  
}
```

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

While the code will compile, it is _not_ logically correct. The snippet below…

```cpp
if(s1map[s2_char] == 0) {  
	return true;  
}  
```

…will just immediately return `true` when it should just `continue`.

###### Notes

﹇<br>
First and foremost, must anagrams have the same number of occurrences? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Yes!!!

﹇<br>
What is the definition of an anagram? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Containers that have the same elements and the same number of occurrences of those elements.

﹇<br>
Is the following code valid? 

```cpp
map2[*it2] = map2[*it2]++;
```

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Yes, but now how you intend it to be.  In the above case, you are essentially calling the post increment, so essentially you are just having `map2[*it2]` be incremented, but then having it be assigned to its previously self so it is essentially overwriting the increment. If you wish to increment an element in a container, just do the following…

```cpp
map2[*it2]++;
```

###### Notes

﹇<br>
When an element, that does not previously exist in a `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` container, is inserted, what value does the expression return? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

```cpp
s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ] = s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ] + 1;
```

The expression, on the right side, `s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ]`, returns 0 if `*(it + i)` did not previously exist in the container.

﹇<br>
What library is `std::unordered_map` from? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

It is from the library `<unordered_map>`.

﹇<br>
Is `std::ordered_map` from the library `<unordered_map>`? 

#card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

No, it is from the library `<ordered_map>`.
