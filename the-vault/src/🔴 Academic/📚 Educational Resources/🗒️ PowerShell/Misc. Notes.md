Ôπá<br>
What happens when you create a symbolic link? 

#card 

You are creating a shortcut to an other file or directory.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649953


Ôπá<br>
Does the symbolic link take up a lot of space in your hard drive? 

#card 

No, this is why it can save you space by allowing you to have multiple copies of the same file in different locations without actually taking up the space for each copy.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649959


Ôπá<br>
How do you create  symbolic link in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

You can use the `New-Item` cmdlet with the `ItemType` `SymbolicLink` parameter.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649963


Ôπá<br>
What does the following code do? `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "Link" -Target "Target"` 

#card 

Creates a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *file* "Target".

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649968


Ôπá<br>
Can you create symbolic links to *directories* with PowerShell on Windows? 

#card 

Yes. For example, to create a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *directory* "Target", you can use the following command: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "Link" -Target "Target"`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649973


Ôπá<br>
What are some of the upsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

If you have multiple copies of the same file in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create shortcuts to the file instead of actually copying the file to each location. This can save you a lot of space, especially if the file is large.

If you have a lot of files in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create a central location for all of your files. This can make it easier to find the files you need and to keep track of what files you have.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649977


Ôπá<br>
What are some of the downsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

If you create a <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span> and it does not work, it can be difficult to figure out why.

When you access a <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span>, the operating system has to first find the original file before it can access the file you are trying to access. This can add a few milliseconds to the time it takes to access a file.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649981


Ôπá<br>
What is a cmdlet in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment.

The PowerShell runtime invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line.

The PowerShell runtime also invokes them programmatically through PowerShell APIs.

Cmdlets perform an action and typically return a Microsoft .NET object to the next command in the pipeline.

A cmdlet is a single command that participates in the pipeline semantics of PowerShell.

This includes binary (C#) cmdlets, advanced script functions, CDXML, and Workflows.

<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650005


Ôπá<br>
What does `$PWD` mean in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse 

<span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains the full path of the current directory.

It is a shortcut for <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>. To get the current directory, you can use either <span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> or <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650008


Ôπá<br>
How do I open the current directory in File Explorer?

```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650012


Ôπá<br>
How to test if a file or path exists in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse 

Use the cmdlet `Test-Path`.

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
Test-Path -Path "C:\Documents and Settings\DavidC"
True
```

This command checks whether all elements in the path exist, that is, the¬†`C:`¬†directory, the¬†`Documents and Settings`¬†directory, and the¬†`DavidC`¬†directory. If any are missing, the cmdlet returns¬†`$False`. Otherwise, it returns¬†`$True`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650016

Ôπá<br>
How can you enforce the type of a variable in PowerShell? 

#card 

In PowerShell, you can enforce the type of a variable by using type accelerators or by casting the value to the desired type when you assign it to the variable. 

For example:¬†

```cpp
[int] $myInt = 10
```

or

```cpp
$myInt = [int] 10
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650019

Ôπá<br>
What are type accelerators in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

<span class="spoiler">Type accelerators</span> are aliases for .NET framework classes. They allow you to access specific .NET framework classes without having to explicitly type the entire class name.
- For example, you can shorten the¬†**AliasAttribute**¬†class from¬†`[System.Management.Automation.AliasAttribute]`¬†to¬†`[Alias]`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650023

Ôπá<br>
What are some common types in PowerShell? 

#card 

Some common types in PowerShell include¬†`System.String`,¬†`System.Int32`,¬†`System.Boolean`,¬†`System.DateTime`,¬†`System.Array`,¬†`System.Collections.ArrayList`, and¬†`System.Collections.Hashtable`. PowerShell also has its own set of types that are specific to the language, such as¬†`PSCustomObject`,¬†`PSObject`, and¬†`SwitchParameter`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650027

Ôπá<br>
 What is the definition of a symbolic link? 

#card 

A <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span>, also known as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file that points to another file or directory.

<span class="spoiler">Symbolic links</span> are a useful tool for managing your files. However, it is important to be aware of the downsides before you start using them.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650030

Ôπá<br>
What is the basic syntax of a PowerShell cmdlet? 

#card-reverse  

The <span class="spoiler">basic syntax</span> of a PowerShell <span class="spoiler">cmdlet</span> is "Verb-Noun", where "Verb" represents the action and "Noun" represents the target object.

Can you create an alias for a `cmdlet` or other command in Powershell? 

#card 

Yes, you can create an alias for a cmdlet or other command in PowerShell using the¬†`Set-Alias`¬†cmdlet.
	- The¬†`Name`¬†parameter specifies the alias‚Äôs name and the¬†`Value`¬†parameter specifies the cmdlet that the alias runs.

For example, to create an alias named¬†`list`¬†for the¬†`Get-ChildItem`¬†cmdlet, you would enter¬†`Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem`<sup>[[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7.3)]</sup>.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650091

Ôπá<br>
Can you assign an alias to a command with parameters in PowerShell? 

#card 

You **cannot** assign an alias to a command with parameters using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`.

Instead, you can create a function that contains the command with parameters and then assign an alias to that function.

For example, if you wanted to create an alias named¬†`list`¬†for the¬†`Get-ChildItem`¬†cmdlet with the¬†`-Force`¬†parameter, you could create a function like this:
```PowerShell
function Get-ChildItem-Force { Get-ChildItem -Force }
```
Then, you could create an alias for the function using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`:
```PowerShell
Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem-Force
```

Ôπá<br>
How do you define a default value for a parameter in PowerShell?

#card 

You can define a script¬†`myscript.ps1`¬†that takes in arguments for¬†`name`,¬†`address`, and¬†`age`¬†like this:

```PowerShell
param($name, $address = "USA", $age)
Write-Host "Name: $name"
Write-Host "Address: $address"
Write-Host "Age: $age"
```

Here, the variable¬†`$address`¬†has a default value of¬†`"USA"`. You can then call this script with arguments like this:

```PowerShell
powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25
```

[This will pass the values¬†`"John"`,¬†`"Canada"`, and¬†`25`¬†to the¬†`$name`,¬†`$address`, and¬†`$age`¬†variables respectively](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/powershell/pass-an-argument-to-a-powershell-script/)

Ôπá<br>
What is the command to install all font type extension in Windows? 

#card 

Trick question!
Currently, there is <b>not</b> a singular cmdlet in PowerShell to install fonts. In order to install fonts in PowerShell, you need to move all the appropriate files to the  `C:\Windows\fonts\` folder.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650135

Ôπá<br>
What is wrong with following PowerShell command?

```powershell
Get-Command node | $_.Source
```

#card 

The problem with the command is the use of‚Ä¶ 

```powershell
$_
``` 

‚Ä¶outside of a script block‚Ä¶ 

```powershell
{}
```

The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline, but it's only accessible within a script block.

Here's the corrected command:

```powershell
Get-Command node | ForEach-Object { $_.Source }
```

What is the difference between `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` in PowerShell? 

#card 

`Get-Item` gets the item at the specified location, while `Get-ChildItem` gets the items and child items in one or more specified locations. In other words, `Get-Item` returns information about the targeted item itself, whereas `Get-ChildItem` returns information about the targeted item's children, if the given item happens to be a container ¬π.

What does the following PowerShell command do?

```powershell
$Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

#card 

[This command retrieves the `Path` environment variable for both the `Machine` and `User` scopes, concatenates them with a semicolon separator, and assigns the result to the `$Env:Path` variable in the current PowerShell session](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/)[1](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/). 

This will update the `Path` environment variable in the current session without needing to restart PowerShell.

Without closing a shell session, how can I make a new one/do a hard ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù so that it reloads all environment variables?

#card 

You can‚Äôt, at least easily.

If you need to refresh environment variables, you may need to restart the PowerShell session (easiest way to have your new environment variables is to simply create a new session).

Ôπá<br>
In PowerShell, how can you retrieve the value of an environment variable?

#card 

In PowerShell, you can retrieve the value of an environment variable using the `$env:` syntax followed by the name of the environment variable. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```powershell
$env:VariableName
```

Replace `VariableName` with the name of the environment variable you want to retrieve. For example, to retrieve the system `PATH` variable, you would use:

```powershell
$env:PATH
```

This command retrieves the system `PATH` variable.

You can also list all environment variables with the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Env:
```

This command retrieves all environment variables.

Remember, environment variable names are case-sensitive on non-Windows platforms.
