## :TiNotes: Description

﹇<br>
Mathematically, particularly in the realm of computer science, what is the definition of the **median** of a set of numbers?

#card

In the realm of computer science and statistics, the **median** is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value in a sorted set of numbers. [If the set of numbers is arranged in ascending or descending order, the median is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median). [@wikipediaMedianWikipedia]

The method for calculating the median depends on whether the number of data points is even or odd:

- [If the number of values (n) in the data set is **odd**, then the median is the value at the position `(n + 1)/2`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mean-median-mode/) [@MeanMedianMode]
- [If the number of values (n) in the data set is **even**, then the median is the average of the values at the positions `n/2` and `(n/2) + 1`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mean-median-mode/) [@geeksforgeeksMeanMedianMode

For example, if we have the data set \{1, 2, 3\}, the median is 2, as it is the middle value. [If we have the data set \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, the median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5, which is the average of the two middle values](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mean-median-mode/) [@geeksforgeeksMeanMedianMode

In computer science, the median is often used in algorithms and data structures, such as the Quickselect algorithm, which is used to find the kth smallest number in an unsorted list. [It’s also used in decision trees and machine learning for splitting data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median/) [@geeksforgeeksMedianStatisticsFormula]

When attempting to compute the **median** of a set of numbers, must the numbers first be sorted?

#card 

Yes, to compute the **median** of a set of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted in ascending or descending order. 

The **median** is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data set, and this concept only makes sense once the data set is sorted. 
- If the data set is *not* sorted, it would be <u>impossible</u> to determine which values fall into the higher half and which fall into the lower half. So, sorting is a *necessary* step in computing the median of a set of numbers.

When given a LeetCode style problem like the one below:

> Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. 
> 
> The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

What hint, or intuition, can we infer about the answer given that we want a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(log(m+n))$?

#card 

[The hint or intuition about the answer algorithm given that we want a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(m+n))$ is that we should be thinking about binary search or divide and conquer strategies](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021].

[The $\mathcal{O}(\log(m+n))$ time complexity suggests that with each step or iteration of the algorithm, we’re reducing the problem size by about half](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021]. This is a characteristic of binary search or divide and conquer algorithms, where the problem is divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved independently.

[In the context of this problem, one approach is to partition the two arrays in such a way that elements on the left side are smaller than elements on the right side and the number of elements on both sides are equal or differ by at most 1](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021]. [This can be achieved by binary search](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021].

[We start by partitioning the smaller array (to ensure the binary search range is smaller) and calculate the partition of the second array based on the first one](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021]. [Then we adjust the partition in the first array based on the elements around the partition in both arrays until we reach a stage where elements on the left side of the partition in both arrays are smaller than elements on the right side](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021]. [The median is then calculated based on these partitions](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021].

[This approach ensures that we do not need to merge the arrays and we do not look at all elements of the arrays, thus achieving a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(m+n))$](https://tutorialcup.com/leetcode-solutions/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-leetcode-solution.htm) [@tutorialcupMedianTwoSorted2021].

What hint, or intuition, can we infer about the answer given that the problem states that the input arrays are already sorted.

#card 

The fact that the input arrays are already sorted is a crucial piece of information that can greatly simplify the problem and improve the efficiency of the solution.

Here’s why:

1. <span class="spoiler">**Binary Search**</span>: <span class="spoiler">Since the arrays are sorted, we can use binary search to find the median. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. This is much more efficient than linear search, which would require looking at every element in the arrays.</span>
2. <span class="spoiler">**Two Pointers**</span>: <span class="spoiler">We can use two pointers to traverse the two arrays simultaneously in sorted order. This allows us to find the median without merging the arrays, which would take additional space and time.</span>
3. <span class="spoiler">**Divide and Conquer**</span>: <span class="spoiler">The sorted nature of the arrays allows us to use a divide-and-conquer strategy to find the median. For example, if the median of array A is greater than the median of array B, then the overall median must lie in the right half of A or the left half of B. This allows us to effectively halve the search space with each comparison.</span>

So, the sorted nature of the input arrays is a key factor that allows us to solve this problem efficiently using techniques like binary search and divide and conquer.
