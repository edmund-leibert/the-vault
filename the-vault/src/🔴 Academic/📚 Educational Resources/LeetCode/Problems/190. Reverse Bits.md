## :TiNotes: Description

﹇<br>
In the context of C++, what does the type `uint32_t` mean?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

In C++, the `uint32_t` means an unsigned integer type with a width of _exactly_ 32 bits (provided, if and only if, the implementation directly supports the type) [@FixedWidthInteger]

In C++, what does the following code do?

```cpp
bit = (n >> i) & 1
```

#card 

This line extracts the i-th bit from the integer `n`. It does this by:

- Right-shifting `n` by `i` positions. This moves the i-th bit to the least significant position.
- Applying the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1. This sets all bits to 0 except for the least significant bit.
- Assigning the resulting bit (0 or 1) to the variable `bit`.

In C++, how can you extract the i-th bit from an integer `n`?

#card 

Simply implement the following:
1. Right-shift `n` by `i` positions. This moves the i-th bit to the least significant position.
2. Apply the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1. This sets all bits to 0 _except_ for the least significant bit.
3. Assign the resulting bit (0 or 1) to the variable `bit`.

<u>Implementation</u>:

```cpp
bit = (n >> i) & 1
```
