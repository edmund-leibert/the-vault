Is the following code a valid solution?

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */


class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        auto ptrA = headA;
        auto ptrB = headB;
        while(ptrA != nullptr) {
            while(ptrB != nullptr) {
                if(ptrA == ptrB) {
                    return ptrA;
                }
                else {
                    ptrB = ptrB->next;
                }
            }
            ptrA = ptrA->next;
            ptrB = headB;
        }
        return ptrA;
    }
};
```

While the above solution is logically correct, it is **not** _efficient_. 

First and foremost, this solution uses a brute force approach where for each `ListNode` of “List A”, it does a full iteration through “List B” to see if the `ListNode` of `ptrA` is the intersection. In consequence, this results in the following asymptotic complexity…

**Asymptotic Complexity**
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(N*M)$ <br>
  For each of the $N$ nodes in “List A”, we are traversing over each of the nodes in “List B”. In the worst case, we won’t find a match, and so will need to do this until reaching the end of “List B”, giving a worst-case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \times M)$.
  
- Space complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$ <br>
  We aren't allocating any additional data structures, so the amount of extra space used does not grow with the size of the input.
