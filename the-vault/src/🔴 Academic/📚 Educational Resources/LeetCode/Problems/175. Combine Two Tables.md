In my **PostgreSQL**, note that I am specifying the field/column in my `SELECT` clause, even after the `LEFT JOIN`. Is this necessary? 

Does this necessity also apply for **MySQL**, **Oracle DB**, and **SQL Server**?

```sql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT
    p.firstName AS "firstName",
    p.lastName AS "lastName",
    a.city AS "city",
    a.state AS "state"
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a
    ON 
        p.personId = a.personId
```

In SQL, including **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **Oracle DBMS**, and **SQL Server**, specifying the fields or columns in the `SELECT` clause after a `LEFT JOIN` is not only necessary, but also a good practice for several reasons:

1. **Clarity and Readability**: Specifying the fields makes your query easier to understand and maintain. It’s clear which fields are being returned and from which tables they originate.
2. **Performance**: Selecting only the fields you need can improve performance, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or large text fields.
3. **Avoiding Errors**: If two tables have columns with the same name, not specifying the table could lead to ambiguous column errors.

The query is correctly written. The fields you want to select from the `Person` and `Address` tables after the `LEFT JOIN` have been specified. This is necessary and applies to *all* SQL databases, not just PostgreSQL.

In the context of SQL, is it correct say that the other name of a column is a “field”. Likewise, is a “record” another appropriate name for a row?

Not quite, in the context of SQL, the term “field” is often _incorrectly_ used interchangeably with “column”, while “record” is often used _correctly_ interchangeably with “row”. Here’s a brief explanation:

- **Field**: A field is the intersection of a row and a column. In other words, it’s a single piece of data within a record. Nonetheless, some people _do_ use the term “field” to refer to what SQL calls a “column”.
- **Record**: A record, also referred to as a row or tuple, consists of values for one or more fields relating to a single entry. Each row in a database table represents complete information about an item or entity.

However, it’s important to note that these terms can sometimes be used differently depending on the context or the database system.

What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

**Approach #1**: Simply use a `LEFT JOIN` 🌟

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT 
    p.firstName AS firstName,
    p.lastName AS lastName,
    a.city AS city,
    a.state AS state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
    ON p.personId = a.personId
```

Pretty straight forward solution, just need to practice and make sure I am joining on the right columns!
