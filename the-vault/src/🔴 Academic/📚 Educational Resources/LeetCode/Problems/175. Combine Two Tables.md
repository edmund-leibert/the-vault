In my **PostgreSQL**, note that I am specifying the field/column in my `SELECT` clause, even after the `LEFT JOIN`. Is this necessary? 

Does this necessity also apply for **MySQL**, **Oracle DB**, and **SQL Server**?

```sql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT
    p.firstName AS "firstName",
    p.lastName AS "lastName",
    a.city AS "city",
    a.state AS "state"
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a
    ON 
        p.personId = a.personId
```

[In SQL, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, OracleDB, and SQL Server, specifying the fields or columns in the `SELECT` clause after a `LEFT JOIN` is not only necessary but also a good practice for several reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42667913/select-query-with-join-in-oracle) [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42667913/select-query-with-join-in-oracle):

1. **Clarity and Readability**: Specifying the fields makes your query easier to understand and maintain. It’s clear which fields are being returned and from which tables they originate.
2. **Performance**: Selecting only the fields you need can improve performance, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or large text fields.
3. **Avoiding Errors**: If two tables have columns with the same name, not specifying the table could lead to ambiguous column errors.

Your query is correctly written. You’ve specified the fields you want to select from the `Person` and `Address` tables after the `LEFT JOIN`. This is necessary and applies to all SQL databases, not just PostgreSQL.

What is the _optimal_ solution to this problem? If there are multiple, list them out and compare.

**Approach #1**: Simply use a `LEFT JOIN` ✅

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT 
    p.firstName AS firstName,
    p.lastName AS lastName,
    a.city AS city,
    a.state AS state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
    ON p.personId = a.personId
```

Pretty straight forward solution, just need to practice and make sure I am joining on the right columns!
