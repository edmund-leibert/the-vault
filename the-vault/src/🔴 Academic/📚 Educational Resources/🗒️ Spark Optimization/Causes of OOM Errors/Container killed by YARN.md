1. **Inadequate Memory for Task Execution**: Spark tasks within an executor require a certain amount of memory to function efficiently. When you allocate only 10% of the total memory to the executor, it may not have enough memory to accommodate the data, intermediate results, and other resources required for task execution. As a result, tasks might fail or perform poorly, leading to container termination.

2. **Data Spilling**: Spark may need to cache or spill data to disk if there isn't enough memory to hold it in-memory. If you've allocated only 10% of the memory, it's more likely that Spark will need to spill data to disk more frequently, which can lead to increased I/O operations and reduced performance.

3. **GC Overhead**: Garbage collection (GC) is a critical aspect of memory management in Java-based applications like Spark. When memory is limited, more frequent and longer GC pauses can occur, which can disrupt task execution and may even lead to container termination if the GC overhead exceeds acceptable limits.

4. **Resource Contention**: In a YARN cluster, multiple applications and containers may be running concurrently. If your Spark executor doesn't have enough memory, it can lead to resource contention with other containers, causing YARN to kill the container to prevent resource starvation for other applications.

5. **OOM (Out of Memory) Errors**: With only 10% of the memory allocated, Spark may run into out-of-memory errors more frequently, which can lead to task failures and container termination.

To resolve these issues and optimize Spark performance, it's essential to allocate an appropriate amount of memory to Spark executors based on your specific workload and cluster resources. This allocation should consider factors like the size of your data, the complexity of your Spark job, and the available cluster resources. You may need to adjust memory settings such as `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.driver.memory`, and `spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead` to ensure Spark has sufficient resources to execute tasks without running into memory-related problems.
