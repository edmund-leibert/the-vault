The cluster. This is an optimization technique for small DataFrames that can significantly improve join performance by reducing data shuffling across the network. However, when not used judiciously, broadcast joins can lead to out of memory errors. Here's how:

1. **Data Size**: The primary reason for out of memory errors in broadcast joins is the size of the data being broadcasted. When you broadcast a DataFrame or RDD, it means that a copy of that entire dataset is sent to every worker node in the cluster. If the DataFrame being broadcasted is too large, it can exhaust the memory resources available on each worker node.

1. **Driver Memory**: The driver program in Spark orchestrates the execution of tasks across worker nodes and maintains metadata about the job. If you attempt to broadcast a large dataset that exceeds the driver's available memory, it can result in an out of memory error in the driver itself. 
2. When you do `broadcast` the driver takes the files to be broadcasted from the executors and combines them. If the combined files exceeds the size of driver memory itâ€™ll lead to OOM in driver node.

3. **Executor Memory**: Each worker node in the Spark cluster has a limited amount of memory allocated to it. If the broadcasted dataset is too large to fit into the memory of any worker node, it can lead to out of memory errors on those nodes during the execution of the join.

4. **Concurrency**: Broadcasting a large dataset can also impact the concurrency of your Spark job. Since memory is being consumed by the broadcasted data, there may be less memory available for other tasks, leading to contention and slowdowns in your Spark application.

To avoid out of memory errors when using broadcast joins in Apache Spark, consider the following best practices:

1. **Broadcast Smaller Dataframes**: Only broadcast DataFrames that are small enough to fit comfortably in the memory of all worker nodes. Small dataframes are typically those that are a few gigabytes or less in size.

2. **Adjust Configuration**: You can configure Spark to limit the maximum size of a DataFrame that can be broadcasted using the `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` configuration parameter. You can increase or decrease this threshold based on your cluster's available memory and the size of your data.

3. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use Spark's built-in monitoring tools to keep an eye on memory usage during job execution. Tools like Spark's Web UI and metrics can help you identify memory-related issues early on.

4. **Consider Alternative Join Types**: If you're dealing with larger datasets that can't be broadcasted, consider using other join types like shuffle joins. While they may be slower, they are more memory-efficient for large datasets.

5. **Increase Driver memory**: so that it can combine larger data frames in memory.

In summary, broadcast joins in Apache Spark can lead to out of memory errors when the size of the broadcasted data exceeds the available memory on worker nodes or the driver. It's crucial to carefully manage and monitor memory usage when using broadcast joins to ensure the stability and performance of your Spark applications

### Minimum threshold limit to be eligible for automatic broadcast join

In Spark, when you perform a join operation between two DataFrames or Datasets, the optimizer will consider the size of the smaller DataFrame or Dataset. If the estimated size of the smaller DataFrame is below a certain configurable threshold, Spark may decide to broadcast it to all worker nodes for more efficient join processing.

The configuration parameter that controls this behavior is `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`. This parameter is set in bytes and determines the threshold for automatic broadcast joins. If the estimated size of the smaller DataFrame is less than this threshold, Spark will automatically choose to use a broadcast join.

You can configure this threshold according to your cluster's available memory and the specific requirements of your job. The default value is usually set to `10MB`. However, you can adjust it as needed. For example:
