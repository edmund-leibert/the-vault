Ôπá<br>
What _namespace_ in .NET provides functionality for _serializing_ to and _deserializing_ form **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation (JSON)?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp

[The `System.Text.Json` namespace in .NET provides high-performance, low-allocating, and standards-compliant capabilities to process JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json?view=net-8.0) [@dotnet-botSystemTextJson]. [It includes serializing objects to JSON text and deserializing JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json?view=net-8.0)  [@dotnet-botSystemTextJson]. [It also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM) for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json?view=net-8.0) [@dotnet-botSystemTextJson].

[Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the `System.Text.Json` namespace to serialize an object to JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/how-to) [@genevievewarrenHowSerializeJSON2023]:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.Json;

namespace SerializeBasic
{
    public class WeatherForecast
    {
        public DateTimeOffset Date { get; set; }
        public int TemperatureCelsius { get; set; }
        public string? Summary { get; set; }
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var weatherForecast = new WeatherForecast
            {
                Date = DateTime.Parse("2019-08-01"),
                TemperatureCelsius = 25,
                Summary = "Hot"
            };

            string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(weatherForecast);
            Console.WriteLine(jsonString);
        }
    }
}
```

[This code creates a `WeatherForecast` object, serializes it to a JSON string using the `JsonSerializer.Serialize` method, and then writes the JSON string to the console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/how-to) [@genevievewarrenHowSerializeJSON2023]. [The output will be a minified JSON string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/how-to) [@genevievewarrenHowSerializeJSON2023].

When you run this program, it will print a JSON string to the console that represents the `WeatherForecast` object. The JSON string will look something like this:

```json
{"Date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00","TemperatureCelsius":25,"Summary":"Hot"}
```

This string represents a `WeatherForecast` with a `Date` of ‚Äú2019-08-01‚Äù, a `TemperatureCelsius` of 25, and a `Summary` of ‚ÄúHot‚Äù

Ôπá<br>
In the context of **C#**,  and more generally **.NET**, does the _serialized form_ include any information about an object‚Äôs associated _methods_?

#card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/csharp 

[In C#, and generally in most programming languages, serialization does **not** include an object‚Äôs methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042665/what-is-the-meaning-of-serialization-in-programming-languages). [Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/) [\[3\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/) [\[4\]](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/serialization-and-deserialization-in-c-sharp/). [The serialized form includes only the data members (fields and properties) of the object](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042665/what-is-the-meaning-of-serialization-in-programming-languages).

Here‚Äôs an example to illustrate this. Consider a class `Person` that is defined in a file `Person.cs`, inside a namespace `MyApp.Models`, with properties and a method:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public string GetGreeting()
    {
        return $"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am {Age} years old.";
    }
}
```

Now, let‚Äôs create an instance of this class and serialize it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.Json;
using MyApp.Models; // Included the namespace where Person class is defined

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var person = new Person
        {
            Name = "John Doe",
            Age = 30
        };

        string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);
        Console.WriteLine(jsonString);
    }
}
```

When you run this program, it will print a JSON string to the console that represents the `Person` object. The JSON string will look something like this:

```json
{"Name":"John Doe","Age":30}
```

As you can see, the serialized JSON string includes the values of the `Name` and `Age` properties, but it does not include any information about the `GetGreeting()` method. [This is because serialization is about capturing the state (data) of an object, not its behavior (methods)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2767893/are-methods-also-serialized-along-with-the-data-members-in-net) [\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042665/what-is-the-meaning-of-serialization-in-programming-languages).

Ôπá<br>
In the below code, why must the function `Main` have the `async Task<int>` attribute prepended to it? 

```csharp
internal abstract class MerriamWebsterAnkiFlashcardsGenerator
{
    private static HttpClient sharedClient = new()
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"),
    };
    private static async Task<int> Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        using HttpResponseMessage response = await sharedClient.GetAsync("todos/3");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();      
        // print the response content to the console
        string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        Console.WriteLine(responseContent);    
        return 0;
    }
}
```

#card 

Asynchronous methods in C# typically return a `Task` or `Task<T>`, and they should be awaited with the `await` keyword.

When you use the `await` keyword on a Task, the method in which the `await` keyword is used must be marked as `async`. This is the signal to the compiler that the method contains an awaited asynchronous operation.

The `Main` method in this case returns a `Task<int>` because it's an async method and has a return type of `int`. If it didn't return a value, it would return `Task`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738298

Ôπá<br>
What does `Task<int>` signify in the context of an `async` method like `Main` in a C# program?

#card 

`Task<int>` is the return type of an asynchronous method that returns an integer. The `Task` represents an ongoing work that will eventually complete and produce a result of the type specified, in this case, an `int`. 

The `async` keyword allows the `await` keyword to be used in the method, which means the method will be executed asynchronously. The `Main` method returns `Task<int>` to indicate that it's an asynchronous method that will eventually produce an integer result (usually a status code).

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738308

Ôπá<br>
Why is the `Main` function in C# programs marked with `async` when using `HttpClient.GetAsync`?

#card 

 The `Main` function is marked with `async` because `HttpClient.GetAsync` is an asynchronous method, and any method that uses the `await` keyword must be marked as `async`. This lets the compiler know that the method contains an awaited asynchronous operation.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738315

Ôπá<br>
What does `ReadAsStringAsync` do in the context of an `HttpResponseMessage`?

#card 

The `ReadAsStringAsync` method is used to asynchronously read the content from the HTTP response as a string. It reads the byte stream from the HTTP response and converts it into a string using the encoding specified in the HTTP response.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738323

Ôπá<br>
What are the benefits of reading the content of an HTTP response asynchronously?

#card 

Reading the content asynchronously allows the application to do other work while waiting for the IO operation to complete. It makes the application more efficient and responsive, especially for IO-bound operations.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738331

Ôπá<br>
What is the difference between thread-based operations and IO Completion Port (IOCP)-based operations?

#card 

Thread-based operations dedicate a thread for each IO operation, blocking it until the operation completes. This can be inefficient and resource-intensive. 

IOCP-based operations, on the other hand, use a pool of threads to handle multiple concurrent IO operations, increasing efficiency and performance.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738341

Ôπá<br>
How does .NET implement IOCP-based operations?

#card 

While developers don't directly create and manage IOCPs in C#, the .NET Framework's implementation of async/await and Task uses IOCP under the hood on Windows. When these features are used, they automatically leverage IOCP-based operations.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738348

Ôπá<br>
In .NET how do you ensure the success of a response?

#card 

Use the method `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`. For example‚Ä¶

```csharp
using HttpResponseMessage response = await sharedClient.GetAsync("");
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738358

In C#, the {`internal`} keyword is an access modifier that makes a member (like a method, property, or class) accessible only within its own assembly. An assembly in .NET is a unit of deployment like a `.dll` or `.exe` file.
^1702296738373

If you wanted to allow any code in any assembly to access a specific method, you would make it {`public`} instead. If you wanted to restrict access to only the containing class, you would use {`private`}. If you wanted to allow access from the containing class and any derived classes, you would use {`protected`}.
^1702296738384

Ôπá<br>
What is the default access modifier in C#?

#card 

`internal`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738391

Ôπá<br>
What is the importance of `this` in the method argument of the below code? 

```csharp
internal static void WriteRequestToConsole(this HttpResponseMessage response)
{
    ...
}
```

#card 

The `this` keyword in front of `HttpResponseMessage response` indicates that `WriteRequestToConsole` is an extension method that can be called on instances of `HttpResponseMessage`. So, instead of calling the method like this:

```csharp
HttpResponseMessageExtensions.WriteRequestToConsole(response);
```

You can call it directly on an instance of `HttpResponseMessage`, like this:

```csharp
response.WriteRequestToConsole();
```

The latter is more intuitive and allows for more fluent and readable code, which is one of the main advantages of extension methods.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738404

Ôπá<br>
What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in the argument list of a method in C#?

#card 

The `this` keyword in the argument list of a method is used to create an extension method in C#. An extension method is a static method that can be called as if it were an instance method of the extended type. The `this` keyword in front of the first parameter specifies the type the method will operate on. For example, in `WriteRequestToConsole(this HttpResponseMessage response)`, `this` indicates that `WriteRequestToConsole` is an extension method that can be called on instances of `HttpResponseMessage`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738415

Ôπá<br>
How would you write an extension method for the class `HttpResponseMessage`?

#card 

```csharp
ExtensionMethod(this HttpResponseMessage response)
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738431

Ôπá<br>
In C#, how would you create a global variable for the entire executable and that would be called rom other classes too?

#card 

In C#, you typically don't create global variables as you might in other programming languages. Instead, you would usually create a public static property in a static class. This property can then be accessed from any other class in your application.

Here is an example:

```csharp
public static class GlobalVariables
{
    public static string GlobalString { get; set; }
}
```

You can then access this property from any other class in your application, like this:

```csharp
GlobalVariables.GlobalString = "Hello, World!";
// Getting the value
string myString = GlobalVariables.GlobalString;
```

This will effectively give you a "global" variable, in the sense that it's accessible from any part of your application. However, be aware that using such globally accessible data can lead to problems if not managed carefully, such as making the code harder to understand and maintain, and potentially causing issues with concurrency in multi-threaded applications. It's often better to pass data explicitly through method parameters and return values, or use dependency injection to provide dependencies to classes that need them.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738438

Ôπá<br>
Factoring in that, in .NET, it is considered better to pass data explicitly through method parameter and return values, or use dependency injection to provide dependencies to classes that need them, how should we handle a `HttpClient` instance?

#card 

Generally, a `HttpClient` instance is a good candidate for using a singleton or shared object in your application because of its connection pooling capabilities. In other words, reusing it for the lifetime of your application is recommended as per Microsoft‚Äôs guidelines.

<br>Ôπà<br>^1702296738448


Ôπá<br>
Can I have an async method in C# return a string?

#card 

Yes, an async method in C# can return a string. However, the method signature would need to return a `Task<string>`, because asynchronous methods need to return a `Task` or `Task<T>`.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetStringAsync() {
	await Task.Delay(1000);  // simulate async work with a delay     
	return "Hello, World!"; 
} 
private static async Task Main(string[] args) {     
	string result = await GetStringAsync();     
	Console.WriteLine(result);  // Outputs: Hello, World! 
}
```

Ôπá<br>
What does distributed development entail in the context of C#/.NET development?

#card 

Distributed development refers to the practice of developing software in a distributed computing environment, where different components of a software system can run on different systems (or servers), potentially across different locations.

Here are a few elements it might entail in the context of C# and .NET development:
1. **Microservices:** One common approach to distributed development is microservices architecture, where each service runs independently but communicates with others. Each service would have its own database and would be loosely coupled with the other services.
2. **Communication Between Services:** Distributed development requires mechanisms for the different services to communicate with each other. This might include using HTTP/REST, gRPC (a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google), or even a message bus such as RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus.
3. **Distributed Databases:** Your application might also interact with databases that are distributed across different locations. You'd need to understand concepts like data replication, sharding, and consistency models.
4. **Containerization and Orchestration:** Tools like Docker are often used to package and distribute the individual components of a distributed system. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes help manage these containers, handling deployment, scaling, and management.
5. **Cloud Computing Platforms:** Distributed systems often run on cloud platforms, like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. Understanding how to develop, deploy, and manage applications on these platforms can be a crucial part of distributed development.
6. **Distributed Tracing and Logging:** In a distributed system, being able to trace a transaction or operation across multiple services becomes critical for debugging and performance monitoring. Tools like Serilog, along with services like Azure Application Insights or AWS X-Ray, can help with this.
7. **Resiliency and Fault Tolerance:** In distributed systems, dealing with failures becomes more complex. You may need to implement patterns like Circuit Breaker, Retry, or Fallback to handle potential issues.
8. **Distributed Caching:** In order to reduce latency and increase performance, distributed caching like Redis might be used.
9. **Concurrency and Synchronization:** Dealing with concurrency and synchronization in a distributed environment can be complex, and might involve using locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives, and dealing with issues like race conditions and deadlocks.

Keep in mind that distributed development usually involves a lot more than just knowledge of a programming language like C# and a framework like .NET. It includes understanding distributed system principles, various tools, and technologies.

What is **cron** and what is it used for?

#card 

The `cron` command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts), also known as **cron jobs**, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

It typically automates system maintenance or administration‚Äîthough its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.
