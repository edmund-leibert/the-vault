In the context of Apache Spark, "executor" and "executor core" are two related but distinct concepts that play crucial roles in distributed data processing. Let's explore the differences between them:

1. **Spark Executor**:
   - An executor in Spark is a worker node responsible for running tasks as part of a Spark application. Executors are distributed across the cluster and are responsible for executing the code that makes up a Spark application.
   - Executors are launched on worker nodes (typically cluster nodes) by the Spark driver program, and they remain active throughout the lifetime of the Spark application.
   - Executors are JVM (Java Virtual Machine) processes that run user code, and each executor has its own heap memory for storing data and processing tasks.
   - Executors communicate with the driver and with each other to coordinate the execution of tasks in a Spark job.

2. **Executor Core**:
   - An executor core, also known as a CPU core, refers to a physical or logical CPU core within a worker node where Spark tasks are executed. It represents the computational capacity available for processing tasks on a single executor.
   - Spark allows you to configure the number of executor cores for each executor, which determines how many tasks can be executed concurrently on that executor.
   - The concept of executor cores is important for resource management and parallelism control in Spark applications. Properly configuring the number of executor cores is crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization.

Key Differences:
- Executors are entire worker nodes or JVM processes that execute Spark tasks, whereas executor cores refer to the individual CPU cores within those executor processes.
- Executors are responsible for managing resources such as memory and cores, while executor cores are units of computational capacity within an executor.
- The number of executor cores is typically specified when configuring Spark, and it affects the parallelism of task execution. It determines how many tasks can run concurrently on each executor.
- Executors can run multiple tasks concurrently, with each task utilizing one or more executor cores, depending on the configuration.

In summary, Spark executors are the larger units responsible for executing tasks in a Spark application and managing resources, while executor cores are the individual CPU cores within those executors that determine how many tasks can run in parallel on a single executor. Properly configuring these resources is essential for optimizing Spark application performance in a distributed computing environment.



- Executor = jvm process = Yarn container , it will allocate cores to queued up tasks 1 task = processes 1 partition data = needs 1 thread = which runs on 1 cpu core 
- Executor core = spark.executor.cores e.g. 
- e.g. if you have 200 partitions in dataframe 
	- -> spark.executor.instances = 1 
	- -> spark.executor.cores = 4 = 4 cpu cores 
	- -> # of partitions = 200 
	- -> Initially 200 threads will be created to process 200 partitions, they will be queued in thread pool 
	- -> As we have only 4 cpu cores available, only 4 tasks can be started in parallel. ie 4 threads can run simultaneously. 
	- -> So, 200/4 = 50 number of cycles will be needed. i.e. *ideally* and *theoretically*, each of 4 cpu core will process 50 threads Sequentially. 
	- -> Executor core is NOT thread, though we can say 1 thread needs 1 core for processing
