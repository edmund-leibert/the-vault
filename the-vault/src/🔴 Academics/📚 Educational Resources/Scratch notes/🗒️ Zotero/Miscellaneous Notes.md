As of Feb. 10, 2024 02:15:49 PM, in the context of using **Zotero**, what does the field **Short Title** refer to?

#anki-card

In **Zotero**, the **Short Title** field serves as a way to provide an abbreviated or concise version of a longer title [@zoteroZoteroItemTypes]. It‚Äôs particularly useful when you need to cite a work multiple times within your research or writing. Let me explain further and provide an example:

**Purpose of the Short Title Field**:
- The **Short Title** field allows you to create a shorter, more manageable version of a title for use in citations, footnotes, or in-text references.
- When you cite a source repeatedly, using the full title every time can be cumbersome. The **Short Title** provides a convenient alternative.

**Example of How to Fill Out the Short Title Field**:
- Suppose you‚Äôre working with a book titled: _The Discourse on the Bread of Life in John 6_.
- The full title is quite lengthy, so you want to create a shorter version for citation purposes.
- In the **Short Title** field, you can enter: _Discourse on the Bread of Life_.

**Citation Usage**:
- When you cite this book in your paper, you can use the short title:
	- For the first citation: ‚ÄúIn _Discourse on the Bread of Life_, the author‚Ä¶‚Äù
	- For subsequent citations: ‚ÄúAs discussed in _Discourse on the Bread of Life_‚Ä¶‚Äù

Remember that the **Short Title** should be concise but still recognizable enough to refer back to the original work.

As of Feb. 10, 2024 03:09:29 PM, just to further clarify, let consider the case that one is is tasked with citing an article from a website. 

What should he, or she, base the **Short Title** from? The item‚Äôs **Website Title** or just its **Title**?

#anki-card 

When citing the title of a **blog article** from a website, you should generally base the **short title** on the **article title** itself [@zoteroZoteroItemTypes]. Let‚Äôs break it down:

**Article Title**:
- The **article title** is specific to the content you are referencing. It reflects the main topic or subject of the blog post.
- Use the article title as the basis for creating the short title.

**Website Title**:
- The **website title** refers to the name of the entire website or blog where the article is published.
- While the website title is important for identifying the source, it is not typically used as the short title.

**Example**:
- Suppose you are citing an article titled: _The Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Ecosystems_ from the website _EcoScience Blog_.
- Your short title could be: _Climate Change Impact_.

**Citation Usage**:
- In your paper, you can cite the article as follows:
	- First citation: ‚ÄúAccording to _Climate Change Impact_‚Ä¶‚Äù
	- Subsequent citations: ‚ÄúAs discussed in _Climate Change Impact_‚Ä¶‚Äù

In the context of Zotero, specifically the IEEE standard, should all items have an **abstract**? For instance, consider a webpage that does **not** have an abstract like a research paper. 

Would I need to write my own abstract for the item?

#anki-card 

In the IEEE citation style, an abstract is typically provided for research papers to give a brief summary of the research conducted. However, for other types of sources like webpages, an abstract is not typically included in the citation.

As for Zotero, it‚Äôs a tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. When you save a webpage to Zotero, it will try to pull in whatever metadata it can find, but it doesn‚Äôt require an abstract. If the webpage doesn‚Äôt provide an abstract, you don‚Äôt need to write one yourself unless it‚Äôs specifically required for your purposes.

Remember, the goal of citation is to provide enough information to allow others to find the source. So, while an abstract _can_ be helpful for understanding the content of the source, it‚Äôs not typically required for the citation itself. If you‚Äôre unsure, it‚Äôs always a good idea to check with your professor, journal, or whoever is requesting the citation. They can provide guidance on what information should be included.
