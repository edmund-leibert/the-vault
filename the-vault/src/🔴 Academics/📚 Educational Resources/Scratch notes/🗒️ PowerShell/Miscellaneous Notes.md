Ôπá<br>
What happens when you create a symbolic link? 

#anki-card 

You are creating a shortcut to an other file or directory.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649953


Ôπá<br>
Does the symbolic link take up a lot of space in your hard drive? 

#anki-card 

No, this is why it can save you space by allowing you to have multiple copies of the same file in different locations without actually taking up the space for each copy.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649959


Ôπá<br>
How do you create  symbolic link in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse  

You can use the `New-Item` cmdlet with the `ItemType` `SymbolicLink` parameter.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649963


Ôπá<br>
What does the following code do? `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "Link" -Target "Target"` 

#anki-card 

Creates a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *file* "Target".

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649968


Ôπá<br>
Can you create symbolic links to *directories* with PowerShell on Windows? 

#anki-card 

Yes. For example, to create a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *directory* "Target", you can use the following command: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "Link" -Target "Target"`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649973


Ôπá<br>
What are some of the upsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse  

If you have multiple copies of the same file in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create shortcuts to the file instead of actually copying the file to each location. This can save you a lot of space, especially if the file is large.

If you have a lot of files in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create a central location for all of your files. This can make it easier to find the files you need and to keep track of what files you have.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649977


Ôπá<br>
What are some of the downsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse  

If you create a <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span> and it does not work, it can be difficult to figure out why.

When you access a <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span>, the operating system has to first find the original file before it can access the file you are trying to access. This can add a few milliseconds to the time it takes to access a file.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596649981


Ôπá<br>
What is a cmdlet in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse  

A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment.

The PowerShell runtime invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line.

The PowerShell runtime also invokes them programmatically through PowerShell APIs.

Cmdlets perform an action and typically return a Microsoft .NET object to the next command in the pipeline.

A cmdlet is a single command that participates in the pipeline semantics of PowerShell.

This includes binary (C#) cmdlets, advanced script functions, CDXML, and Workflows.

- <span class="spoiler">cmdlets</span>
- <span class="spoiler">advanced script functions</span>
- <span class="spoiler">CDXML</span>
- <span class="spoiler">Workflows</span>

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650005


Ôπá<br>
What does `$PWD` mean in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse 

<span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains the full path of the current directory.

It is a shortcut for <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>. To get the current directory, you can use either <span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> or <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650008


Ôπá<br>
How do I open the current directory in File Explorer? 

#anki-card-reverse  

```powershell
explorer.exe .
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650012


Ôπá<br>
How to test if a file or path exists in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse 

Use the cmdlet `Test-Path`.

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
Test-Path -Path "C:\Documents and Settings\DavidC"
True
```

This command checks whether all elements in the path exist, that is, the¬†`C:`¬†directory, the¬†`Documents and Settings`¬†directory, and the¬†`DavidC`¬†directory. If any are missing, the cmdlet returns¬†`$False`. Otherwise, it returns¬†`$True`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650016

Ôπá<br>
How can you enforce the type of a variable in PowerShell? 

#anki-card 

In PowerShell, you can enforce the type of a variable by using type accelerators or by casting the value to the desired type when you assign it to the variable. 

For example:¬†

```cpp
[int] $myInt = 10
```

or

```cpp
$myInt = [int] 10
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650019

Ôπá<br>
What are type accelerators in PowerShell? 

#anki-card-reverse  

<span class="spoiler">Type accelerators</span> are aliases for .NET framework classes. They allow you to access specific .NET framework classes without having to explicitly type the entire class name.
- For example, you can shorten the¬†**AliasAttribute**¬†class from¬†`[System.Management.Automation.AliasAttribute]`¬†to¬†`[Alias]`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650023

Ôπá<br>
What are some common types in PowerShell? 

#anki-card 

Some common types in PowerShell include¬†`System.String`,¬†`System.Int32`,¬†`System.Boolean`,¬†`System.DateTime`,¬†`System.Array`,¬†`System.Collections.ArrayList`, and¬†`System.Collections.Hashtable`. PowerShell also has its own set of types that are specific to the language, such as¬†`PSCustomObject`,¬†`PSObject`, and¬†`SwitchParameter`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650027

Ôπá<br>
 What is the definition of a symbolic link? 

#anki-card 

A <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span>, also known as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file that points to another file or directory.

<span class="spoiler">Symbolic links</span> are a useful tool for managing your files. However, it is important to be aware of the downsides before you start using them.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650030

Ôπá<br>
What is the basic syntax of a PowerShell cmdlet? 

#anki-card-reverse

Can you create an alias for a `cmdlet` or other command in Powershell? 

#anki-card 

Yes, you can create an alias for a cmdlet or other command in PowerShell using the¬†`Set-Alias`¬†cmdlet.
	- The¬†`Name`¬†parameter specifies the alias‚Äôs name and the¬†`Value`¬†parameter specifies the cmdlet that the alias runs.

For example, to create an alias named¬†`list`¬†for the¬†`Get-ChildItem`¬†cmdlet, you would enter¬†`Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem`<sup>[[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7.3)]</sup>.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650091

Ôπá<br>
Can you assign an alias to a command with parameters in PowerShell? 

#anki-card 

You **cannot** assign an alias to a command with parameters using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`.

Instead, you can create a function that contains the command with parameters and then assign an alias to that function.

For example, if you wanted to create an alias named¬†`list`¬†for the¬†`Get-ChildItem`¬†cmdlet with the¬†`-Force`¬†parameter, you could create a function like this:
```PowerShell
function Get-ChildItem-Force { Get-ChildItem -Force }
```
Then, you could create an alias for the function using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`:
```PowerShell
Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem-Force
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650107

Ôπá<br>
How do you define a default value for a parameter in PowerShell?

#anki-card 

You can define a script¬†`myscript.ps1`¬†that takes in arguments for¬†`name`,¬†`address`, and¬†`age`¬†like this:

```PowerShell
param($name, $address = "USA", $age)
Write-Host "Name: $name"
Write-Host "Address: $address"
Write-Host "Age: $age"
```

Here, the variable¬†`$address`¬†has a default value of¬†`"USA"`. You can then call this script with arguments like this:

```PowerShell
powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25
```

[This will pass the values¬†`"John"`,¬†`"Canada"`, and¬†`25`¬†to the¬†`$name`,¬†`$address`, and¬†`$age`¬†variables respectively](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/powershell/pass-an-argument-to-a-powershell-script/)

<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650111

Ôπá<br>
How can you combine a path and child-path? 

#anki-card 

`Join-Path`¬†is a cmdlet in PowerShell that combines a path and child-path into a single path.¬†The provider supplies the path delimiters[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3).¬†

For example, if you want to combine a path with a child path, you can use¬†`Join-Path -Path "path" -ChildPath "childpath"`¬†which will return¬†`path\childpath`[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3)

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650114

Ôπá<br>
What is SSH? 

#anki-card 

A network protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer.

SSH encrypts all traffic between the client and the server, which protects the user's data from being intercepted.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650125

Ôπá<br>
Lets say I am supposed to `ssh` into the account `lleibert@hills.ccsf.edu`. 

What would be my host? 

#anki-card 

Your host would be `hills.ccsf.edu`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650128

In PowerShell, to print the current host you can use the cmdlet {1:`Get-Host`}.

Ôπá<br>
What is the command to install all font type extension in Windows? 

#anki-card 

Trick question!
Currently, there is <b>not</b> a singular cmdlet in PowerShell to install fonts. In order to install fonts in PowerShell, you need to move all the appropriate files to the  `C:\Windows\fonts\` folder.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650135

The alias for the {1:`Get-Location`} cmdlet is {2:`pwd`}.

Ôπá<br>
What is wrong with following PowerShell command?

```powershell
Get-Command node | $_.Source
```

#anki-card 

The problem with the command is the use of‚Ä¶ 

```powershell
$_
``` 

‚Ä¶outside of a script block‚Ä¶ 

```powershell
{}
```

The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline, but it's only accessible within a script block.

Here's the corrected command:

```powershell
Get-Command node | ForEach-Object { $_.Source }
```

What is the difference between `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` in PowerShell? 

#anki-card 

`Get-Item` gets the item at the specified location, while `Get-ChildItem` gets the items and child items in one or more specified locations. In other words, `Get-Item` returns information about the targeted item itself, whereas `Get-ChildItem` returns information about the targeted item's children, if the given item happens to be a container ¬π.

What is the problem with the following code? 

```powershell
Write-Host $currentDirectory > tmp.txt
```

#anki-card 

`Write-Host` sends information directly to the console, <i>not</i> to a file. If you want to write the value of `$currentDirectory` to a file, you should use either `Out-File` or `Set-Content`. For example‚Ä¶
- `$currentDirectory | Out-File "tmp.txt"`
- `Set-Content -Path "tmp.txt" -Value $currentDirectory`

<br>Ôπà<br>^1701596650164

If you want to append new content to a file, you can use¬†{`Out-File`}. If you want to replace the existing content with new content, you can use¬†{`Set-Content`}.¬†[You should also consider the encoding of the data when choosing which cmdlet to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10655788/powershell-set-content-and-out-file-what-is-the-difference). 
^1701596650168

What is the difference between `Write-Host` and `Write-Information`? 

#anki-card 

`Write-Host` sends information directly to the console. As such, you can *not* pipe/transfer the output of Write-Host
The output of `Write-Information` can be redirected using either the `>` redirection operator or using cmdlets such as `Out-File`

What does the following PowerShell command do?

```powershell
$Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

#anki-card 

[This command retrieves the `Path` environment variable for both the `Machine` and `User` scopes, concatenates them with a semicolon separator, and assigns the result to the `$Env:Path` variable in the current PowerShell session](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/)[1](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/). 

This will update the `Path` environment variable in the current session without needing to restart PowerShell.

Without closing a shell session, how can I make a new one/do a hard ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù so that it reloads all environment variables?

#anki-card 

You can‚Äôt, at least easily.

If you need to refresh environment variables, you may need to restart the PowerShell session (easiest way to have your new environment variables is to simply create a new session).

In PowerShell, how can you retrieve the value of an environment variable?

#anki-card 

In PowerShell, you can retrieve the value of an environment variable using the `$env:` syntax followed by the name of the environment variable. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```powershell
$env:VariableName
```

Replace `VariableName` with the name of the environment variable you want to retrieve. For example, to retrieve the system `PATH` variable, you would use:

```powershell
$env:PATH
```

This command retrieves the system `PATH` variable.

You can also list all environment variables with the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Env:
```

This command retrieves all environment variables.

Remember, environment variable names are case-sensitive on non-Windows platforms.

As of Feb. 18, 2024 11:10:09 AM, in **PowerShell**, what command can I run to list all the current ports open?

#anki-card 

In PowerShell, you can use the `Get-NetTCPConnection` cmdlet to list all the current open ports. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```powershell
Get-NetTcpConnection -State Listen | Select-Object LocalAddress,LocalPort | Sort-Object -Property LocalPort | Format-Table
```

This command will return a list of all open TCP ports on your computer. The `-State Listen` parameter filters for ports that are listening for connections. The `Select-Object` cmdlet is used to select the `LocalAddress` and `LocalPort` properties, which represent the local IP address and port number. The `Sort-Object -Property LocalPort` sorts the output by the local port number, and `Format-Table` formats the output as a table.

If you want to see more details, such as the process ID for each port, you can modify the command like this:

```powershell
Get-NetTcpConnection | Where-Object { ($_.State -eq "Listen") -and ($_.RemoteAddress -eq "0.0.0.0")} | Select-Object LocalAddress,LocalPort,RemoteAddress,RemotePort,State,OwningProcess | Format-Table
```

This command will return the local and remote addresses and ports, the state of the connection, and the process ID (`OwningProcess`) for each open port.

Please note that you need to run these commands in an elevated PowerShell session (Run as Administrator).

As of Mar. 27, 2024 01:30:08 AM, in the context of PowerShell, what does `Get-Content` do?

#anki-card 

`Get-Content` is a cmdlet used in PowerShell to retrieve the contents of a file. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

- **Reads files:** It primarily targets text files, but can also be used with other items that hold content.
- **Line by line processing:** By default, Get-Content reads the content line by line and returns each line as a separate object.
- **Output as a collection:** This collection of objects containing each line can be displayed directly in the console or stored in a variable for further manipulation.

Here are some additional points to note about Get-Content:

- **Aliases:** It has aliases like 'cat' and 'type' for easier use.
- **Specifying path:** You need to provide the path to the file you want to read using the `-Path` parameter.
- **Reading entire content:** To read the whole file at once as a single string, you can use the `-Raw` parameter.
- **Filtering and selecting lines:** Get-Content offers options to filter content based on specific patterns or select a particular number of lines from the beginning or end of the file.

Overall, Get-Content is a fundamental cmdlet for working with text files in PowerShell, allowing you to access, process, and analyze their content.
