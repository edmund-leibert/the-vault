﹇<br>
What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- **Solution from Attempt #3**: Just use the `partition()` function from the `algorithm` library
	- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

- **Official Structy Solution**: two pointers
	```cpp
	#include <vector>
	
	std::vector<int>& fiveSort(std::vector<int> &numbers) {
	  int i = 0;
	  int j = numbers.size() - 1;
	  while (i < j) {
	    if (numbers[j] == 5) {
	      j -= 1;
	    } else if (numbers[i] != 5) {
	      i += 1;
	    } else {      
	      int tmp = numbers[i];
	      numbers[i] = numbers[j];
	      numbers[j] = tmp;
	    }
	  }
	  return numbers;
	}
	```
	- n = vector size
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(1)

What is the difference between `stable_partition` and `partition`?

#anki-card 

`partition` does not keep the relative order of the elements while `stable partition` does.

###### Notes

Is the following code valid?

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

std::vector<int>& fiveSort(std::vector<int> &numbers) {
    // todo

    if(numbers.size() == 1 || numbers.empty()) {
        return numbers;
    }

    auto itL = numbers.begin();
    auto itR = numbers.end() - 1;

    while(itL < itR) {
        while(*itR == 5) {
            itR--;
        }
        if(*itL == 5) {
            swap(*itL, *itR);
            itL++;
        }
    }

    return numbers;
}


void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```

#anki-card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

There are two prominent logical issues with the following code.
1. In the following section of code...
	```cpp
	if(*itL == 5) {
		swap(*itL, *itR);
		itL++;
	}
	```
	We are not accounting for the case where `*itL` is _not_ equal to $5$. Even this case, where we are not swapping, we need to _still_ move `itL` towards the right.
2. Also, you are forgetting the **edge case** of `itR` at the beginning of the loop being moved all the way past `itL` before we check the `itL` value. Need to add a check for if `itR` already has passed `itL`.

**Corrected code**:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

std::vector<int>& fiveSort(std::vector<int> &numbers) {
    // todo

    if(numbers.size() == 1 || numbers.empty()) {
        return numbers;
    }

    auto itL = numbers.begin();
    auto itR = numbers.end() - 1;

    while(itL < itR) {
        while(*itR == 5) {
            itR--;
            if(itL >= itR) {
                return numbers;
            }
        }
        if(*itL == 5) {
            swap(*itL, *itR);
            itL++;
        }
        else {
            itL++;
        }
    }

    return numbers;
}


void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```

﹇<br>
Does `sort()` have the capability to sort all elements of a certain type to the end or beginning of a container? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

No, it does not. For the objective, one should use the `partition()` function.

What function should one use if they wish to sort all elements of a certain type to the end or beginning of a container? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Use the `partition()` function.

﹇<br>
How many arguments does `partition()` have? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

It has three arguments…
1. A `ForwardIterator` for the starting position of the iteration
3. A `ForwardIterator` for the ending position of the iteration
2. An _optional_ predicate.       

An example of a predicate…

```cpp
[](int i){ return i != 5}
```

 *Essentially all values that values that return true will **precede** all values that return false.*

What predicate should I make if I want to move all elements that are 5 to the end of a vector? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

```cpp
[](int i){ return i != 5}
```

Notice the change not equal sign.

What predicate should I make if I want to move all elements that are 5 to the front of a vector?

[](int i){ 
	return i == 5

Notice the equal sign.

What is the difference between `stable_partition()` and `partition()`?

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

`stable_partition` preserves the order of elements.

What is the time complexity of `partition()`? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

Is the generic function `partition(n)` in-place? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Yes.

What is the time complexity of `stable_partition()`? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

`std::space_partition()` is an adaptive algorithm, which means the time complexity depends on the amount of memory available.
- If enough memory available, the function can use a buffer to achieve a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
	- Space complexity in this case is $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- If there is not enough memory available, the function uses an in-place approach with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
	- Space complexity in this case is $\mathcal{O}(1)$

﹇<br>
What is the space complexity of `stable_partition()`? 

#anki-card  #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

There are **2 implementations**.
- "slower" `O(n*logn)` implementation
- "faster" `O(n)` implementation

The **fast** implementation however needs to **use a lot of memory**, which may not be available. So the `stable_partition` asks the operating system if there is enough memory available and then chooses between the two implementations.
