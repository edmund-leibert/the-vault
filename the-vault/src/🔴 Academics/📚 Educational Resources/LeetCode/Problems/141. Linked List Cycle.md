## :TiNotes: Description

Ôπá<br>
When is there a cycle in a linked list?

#anki-card 

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the¬†`next`¬†pointer.

Ôπá<br>
When searching for a element in a set that matches specific frequency target, what is the issue with going along with utilizing a hash map?

#anki-card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

At minimum, your space complexity will be $\mathcal{O}(n)$ since you are using additional memory.

Is Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection algorithm able to detect a cycle in a linked list when it is completely circular (i.e., every node is in the cycle)?

#anki-card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

Yes, Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, can detect a cycle in a linked list even when it is completely circular, meaning every node is in the cycle [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm/) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection).

The algorithm works by maintaining two pointers that traverse the linked list at different speeds: a slow pointer (the tortoise) that moves one node at a time, and a fast pointer (the hare) that moves two nodes at a time [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm/) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection).

If there is a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer within the cycle. This is true regardless of whether some nodes are not in the cycle or all nodes are in the cycle. In the case of a completely circular linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer after it laps the slow pointer in the cycle [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm/) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection).

{1:Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection Algorithm} is also known as the {2:Tortoise and Hare algorithm}.


Ôπá<br>
When using Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Finding algorithm to detect if a linked list has a cycle, what edge cases must I check for?

#anki-card #üî¥-academic/üìö-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

The following edge cases must be checked‚Ä¶
1. Check if the `head` pointer is `nullptr`
2. Check for the case where 
	```cpp
	fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr
	```
