## :TiNotes: Description

﹇<br>
As of Feb. 18, 2024 10:58:07 PM, is it true that for **all** integers `n` that are divisible by 2, then they are a power of two?

#anki-card 

No, consider the number **6**. 

Although 6 is **divisible** by 2, it is **not** a power two.

In consequence, it is **false** that for **all** integers `n` that are divisible by 2, they are a power of two.
