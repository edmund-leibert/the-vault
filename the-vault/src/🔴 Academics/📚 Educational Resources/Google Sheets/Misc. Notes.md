How can you subtract a datetime by 2 hours in google sheets?

#anki-card 

To subtract 2 hours from a datetime in Google Sheets, you can use the following formula: `=A1-TIME(2,0,0)`, where `A1` is the cell containing the datetime you want to subtract from. This will subtract 2 hours from the datetime in `A1`. You can also use the standard `-` operator to subtract two datetimes. 

For example, if you want to subtract the datetime in cell `A1` from the datetime in cell `B1`, you can use the formula `=B1-A1`.
