  abstract = {Can you solve this real interview question? Read N Characters Given Read4 - Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters. Method read4: The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf4. The return value is the number of actual characters read. Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C. Definition of read4:     Parameter:  char[] buf4     Returns:    int buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[]. Below is a high-level example of how read4 works: [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/157\_example.png] File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file ~ Method read: By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate file directly. The return value is the number of actual characters read. Definition of read:     Parameters:	char[] buf, int n     Returns:	int buf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[]. Note:  * Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for read4 but not for read.  * The read function will only be called once for each test case.  * You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing n characters. ~ Example 1: Input: file = "abc", n = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to. Example 2: Input: file = "abcde", n = 5 Output: 5 Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5. Example 3: Input: file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12 Output: 12 Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12. ~ Constraints:  * 1 {$<$}= file.length {$<$}= 500  * file consist of English letters and digits.  * 1 {$<$}= n {$<$}= 1000},

@misc{160IntersectionTwo,
  title = {160. {{Intersection}} of {{Two Linked Lists}}},
  journal = {LeetCode},
  urldate = {2023-11-19},
  abstract = {Can you solve this real interview question? Intersection of Two Linked Lists - Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null. For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1: [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_statement.png] The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure. Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. Custom Judge: The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):  * intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.  * listA - The first linked list.  * listB - The second linked list.  * skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.  * skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node. The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted. ~ Example 1: [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_1\_1.png] Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3 Output: Intersected at '8' Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B. - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory. Example 2: [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_2.png] Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1 Output: Intersected at '2' Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B. Example 3: [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_3.png] Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2 Output: No intersection Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values. Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null. ~ Constraints:  * The number of nodes of listA is in the m.  * The number of nodes of listB is in the n.  * 1 {$<$}= m, n {$<$}= 3 * 104  * 1 {$<$}= Node.val {$<$}= 105  * 0 {$<$}= skipA {$<~$}m  * 0 {$<$}= skipB {$<~$}n  * intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.  * intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect. ~ Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?},

  abstract = {The rise of radical right-wing leaders, parties, movements, and ideas have transformed not only domestic political landscapes but also the direction and dynamics of international relations. Yet for all their emphasis on nationalist identity, on ``America First'' and ``Taking Back Control,'' there is an unmistakable international dimension to contemporary nationalist, populist movements. Yet these movements are also often transnationally linked. We argue that a constitutive part of this globality is the New Right's (NR) own distinctive international political sociology (IPS). Key thinkers of the contemporary NR have, over several decades, theorized and strategically mobilized globalized economic dislocation and cultural resentment, developing a coherent sociological critique of globalization. Drawing on the oft-neglected tradition of elite managerialism, NR ideologues have borrowed freely from Lenin and Schmitt on the power of enmity, as well as from Gramsci and the Frankfurt School on counterhegemonic strategies. Against the temptation to dismiss right-wing ideas as ``merely'' populist and by implication as lacking in ideological and theoretical foundations, we are faced with the much more challenging task of engaging a position that has already developed its own international political sociology and incorporated it into its political strategies.}

  abstract = {This article shows how Poland?s ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), is attempting to apply its general strategy of ?elite replacement? in a modified way to civil society. Since independent civil society organizations are not subject to arbitrary state control of appointments (unlike public institutions), this strategy has required a more complex dual approach of pressure and promotion. Organizations perceived as hostile to the party and its values have been subject to the withdrawal of state support and smear campaigns. By contrast, organizations that are politically or ideologically linked to the party have found support in the form of new public funds and other institutional assistance. This article examines the practical functioning and consequences of these processes through two main examples: (1) a state-sponsored campaign against one of Poland?s largest independent charity organizations, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity and (2) the funding of multiple right-wing NGOs friendly to PiS by the newly established National Freedom Institute. The article shows how PiS?s dual strategy in civil society reinforces its political narratives through support of the broader right-wing cultural narratives that underpin them. At the same time, it demonstrates how funding of friendly organizations directly strengthens party structures by fostering the development of new political and administrative cadres. By analysing PiS?s specific methods of pressure and promotion in the sphere of civil society, the article shows the intertwining of political and cultural narratives and goals within a right-wing populist framework.}

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2023-11-03},
  abstract = {In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making                         O         (         log         ⁡         n         )                 \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle O({\textbackslash}log n)\}    comparisons, where                         n                 \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n\}    is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array. There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.},

  abstract = {Exclusive or or exclusive disjunction or exclusive alternation or logical non-equivalence or logical inequality is a logical operator whose negation is the logical biconditional. With two inputs, XOR is true if and only if the inputs differ (one is true, one is false). With multiple inputs, XOR is true if and only if the number of true inputs is odd.It gains the name "exclusive or" because the meaning of "or" is ambiguous when both operands are true. XOR excludes that case. Some informal ways of describing XOR are "one or the other but not both", "either one or the other", and "A or B, but not A and B".

Now clearly observing the data we see that 171 cm is the middle term in the given data thus, we can say that the median height of the friends is, 171 cm. A Median is a middle value for sorted data. The sorting of the data can be done either in ascending order or descending order. A median divides the data into two equal halves. Median is among one of the three measures of the central tendency and finding the median gives us very useful insight into the given set of data.

  abstract = {In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node. The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is an almost complete binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm. Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height{\textemdash}a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height. Note that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents, etc. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.},

  urldate = {2022-12-01},
  abstract = {A copy of the first edition of the Principia that Newton annotated in the margin and on interleaved sheets with his own amendments. The project of amending the first edition of the Principia began quite early. During the 1690s, Newton seemed set on the production of a new edition of the Principia, yet despite the efforts of Nicolas Fatio de Duillier and David Gregory, it appeared that the second edition of the Principia was running into the sand. It seems that material concerns, as much as anything else, finally brought a second edition of the Principia to the press. Richard Bentley, who had been one of the first serious expositors of the Principia in the early 1690s, noticed that copies of the work were becoming increasing hard to find and fetched a high price. In the mid-1690s, Bentley had been instrumental in the establishment of the University Press in Cambridge under the direction of the Vice-Chancellor. Despite its considerable scholarly achievements, the new Press was not a financial success and Bentley and his collaborators remained on the lookout for suitable books that might turn a small profit. A second edition of the Principia appeared to be one of these. In 1708, Bentley persuaded Newton to allow him to prepare a specimen for this publication at the Cambridge University Press. Bentley had already managed to talk Newton into allowing William Whiston to edit and print a manuscript of his lectures on algebra, supposedly delivered in the 1670s and early 1680s [Dd.9.68]. He was now able to offer Newton freedom from the concerns that perhaps most bothered him about a new edition of his most important work: the trouble of finding suitable printers and the cost in terms of time of correcting and seeing the book through the press. Bentley was well aware of the difficulty that English compositors had in setting complex Latin texts and of the extra demands that this might impose on the author. At first, he proposed to look after the production of the Principia himself, but as its demands became more complicated he abandoned the work. Bentley recommended, however, that Roger Cotes, the young Plumian Professor of astronomy in Cambridge, supervise the edition for Newton. The result was a collaboration that substantially improved the text of the Principia, despite the delays that were introduced by the realisation that several parts of Book II and Book III in particular needed further consideration. Indeed, Section VII, Book II, was almost entirely rewritten, as well as the opening of Book III. The cooperation between Newton and Cotes can be followed by reading their correspondence which is in part available at Cotes correspondence. Adv.b.39.1, together with other sources such as the annotated copy of the Principia from Newton's Library (Trinity College, shelfmark NQ.16.200) and the Liber Secundus Add. 3990, allows scholars to obtain important information about Newton's protracted reworking of the first edition. For example, at the start of Book 3 [p. 402], Newton had defined a number of `Hypotheses' governing his approach to natural phenomenon. In revising the Principia, he developed these hypotheses into a set of rules: `Hypotheses' was firmly crossed through and replaced with `Regul{\ae} philosophandi' (`Rules of philosophising'). The book was severely damaged by fire and damp [pp. 347 ff.] some time before it was given to the Library in 1872 as part of the Portsmouth collection. A BBC Radio 4 'In Our Time' discussion of Newton's laws of motion can be listened to here Niccol{\`o} Guicciardini, Universit{\`a} degli Studi di Milano, and Scott Mandelbrote, Peterhouse, Cambridge.

  abstract = {Brexit and the election of President Trump in the United States are the result of the rise of far-right populist movements which can be observed in Europe, North America, and other regions of the world. Whereas populism itself is one response to neoliberalism, globalization, and austerity measures, the election of Trump, in particular, has caused a new wave of protest. To a far lesser extent, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the European Union in March 2017, people in the UK and many European countries participated in a March for Europe. These demonstrations represent counter-movements to the growing presence of right-wing, anti-immigrant, racist, nationalist, sexist, homophobic, anti-semitic and anti-Muslim movements throughout Europe and the United States. This rapid response issue surveys right-wing populist and left-liberal counter-movements which represent different responses to neoliberalism, globalization, austerity, and to each other. Social movements reflect and contribute to social change and need to be understood from an intersectional perspective. Networked media play an important role for both populist movements from the right and progressive counter-movements.}

This book covers that literature, focuses on how the radical right manifests itself as movements rather than parties, and include a number of case studies both in Europe and beyond. The chapters cover concepts and definitions; ideologies and discourses; a range of contemporary issues including religion, globalization, gender, and activism; and cases such as France, Russia, the United States, Australia, Israel, and Japan. By integrating various strands of scholarship on the radical right, the book provides an authoritative and state-of-the-art overview of the topic and sets the agenda for future scholarship on the radical right for years to come.},

This study proposes an alternative framework for FRP emergence by applying a more active ? social movement ? theory, namely the political process model. The political process model consists of three distinct dimensions that can individually affect FRP emergence. Together, they serve as necessary, but also sufficient, conditions for FRP emergence. First, political opportunities refer to dynamic factors outside the FRP that can provide a favourable (institutional) environment for emergence. Second, resource mobilisation refers to more structural factors through which people can mobilise and engage in collective action. Third, a situationally adjusted master frame includes cognitive and cultural factors that allow FRPs to attract both electoral and financial support. While the model is not without its criticisms, this study argues it provides a much-needed complement to more structural and variable-oriented theories of FRP emergence.}

This finding illustrates the ideological aspects behind organisational choices: For populist parties, in particular, it is important to signal societal rootedness and ``closeness to the people.'' It furthermore challenges the idea that there is a one-way teleological movement towards more lean, electoral-professional kinds of party organisation. At the same time, the case studies clearly illustrate that RWPP leaders and executives continue to exercise great power over their members, who are essentially offered ``participation without power.''},

For a data set, it may be thought of as "the middle" value. The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the "average") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of the center. Median income, for example, may be a better way to describe center of the income distribution because increases in the largest incomes alone have no effect on median. For this reason, the median is of central importance in robust statistics.},

  abstract = {How do the Internet and social media affect political outcomes? We review empirical evidence from the recent political economy literature, focusing primarily on work that considers traits that distinguish the Internet and social media from traditional off-line media, such as low barriers to entry and reliance on user-generated content. We discuss the main results about the effects of the Internet in general, and social media in particular, on voting, street protests, attitudes toward government, political polarization, xenophobia, and politicians? behavior. We also review evidence on the role of social media in the dissemination of fake news, and we summarize results about the strategies employed by autocratic regimes to censor the Internet and to use social media for surveillance and propaganda. We conclude by highlighting open questions about how the Internet and social media shape politics in democracies and autocracies.}
